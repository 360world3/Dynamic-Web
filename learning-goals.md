# Learning goals

Upon completion of this unit you will (hopefully) be able to: 

* Create **proof-of-concept functional prototypes** for Web applications, which manipulate data from online database(s) and/or API(s).

* Critically analyse the **mechanics** of a Web application, breaking down its behaviour into *data*, *functions* and *logic*.

* Understand the role of the three pillar **technologies** of the Web: *HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*.

* Understand how **data APIs** work (HTTP requests, API keys, URL parameters) and hook up one (or more) APIs to your Web application.

* **Research** and use **code libraries** (such as *jQuery*) and integrate them in your project.

* **Document** your design and development process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including *successes* and *failures*.

* **Communicate** your ideas both technically and in an engaging way.

* **Back-up** your project files using the Git version-control system (through GitHub).


Skills learnt in this unit will lay the foundations for later units in the year curriculum.
