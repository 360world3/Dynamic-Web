## Week 1

* Content was pitched at the right level, not too much, not too little. 
* Good to do a recap of HTML & CSS (especially CSS)
* Used CityMapper as a reference to illustrate the use of libraries and APIs (could have included http://stackshare.io/citymapper/citymapper maybe?), and when styling the `app template`
* Interesting discussion around the difference between `website` and `app`. *Is this an app or a website?* in most cases the answer can be *both*: it uses Web technologies and it's accessible online so it's technically a `website`, but the way you use it is more like a *tool*
* Used https://randomuser.me to play around with the idea of using URLs to request data; getting fun, visual results 
* Introducing jQuery as a `CSS-like` library seemed to make sense
* People got really excited when they got the `Back` button to switch between sections. Seems like a digestible way to introduce programming (brackets are still quite confusing though)
* Had fun with camel cases and variable names, eg: `var Â£ = jQuery`

## Week 2

### Peer learning

* Make the groups and/or assign topics?

* [Objects of intense feeling](http://computationalculture.net/article/objects-of-intense-feeling-the-case-of-the-twitter-api) too long and hard to make sense of. Maybe give them only one section of it to research and comment on (3-4 minutes read).

### Tutorials

Didn't get time to do that..
