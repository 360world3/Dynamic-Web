# 2016

## Week 1

* Content was pitched at the right level, not too much, not too little. 
* Good to do a recap of HTML & CSS (especially CSS)
* Used CityMapper as a reference to illustrate the use of libraries and APIs (could have included http://stackshare.io/citymapper/citymapper maybe?), and when styling the `app template`
* Interesting discussion around the difference between `website` and `app`. *Is this an app or a website?* in most cases the answer can be *both*: it uses Web technologies and it's accessible online so it's technically a `website`, but the way you use it is more like a *tool*
* Used https://randomuser.me to play around with the idea of using URLs to request data; getting fun, visual results 
* Introducing jQuery as a `CSS-like` library seemed to make sense
* People got really excited when they got the `Back` button to switch between sections. Seems like a digestible way to introduce programming (brackets are still quite confusing though)
* Had fun with camel cases and variable names, eg: `var Â£ = jQuery`


## Week 2

* Peer-learning: most groups opted for the safe powerpoint-style presentation, only one team proposed an unplugged activity. Maybe force them to use unplugged. And/or I should have modelled an unplugged activity (like the robot-game) in class before! 
* USER+HTML+JS+DB unplugged seems to engage people and it's a digestible demonstration of the app mechanics.
* Workshop was a bit too long (10-15 minutes) and people seemed to be overwhelmed by the end of the session (probably also for the lack of fresh air in the room.

### Peer-learning

##### Will & Akvile | What are **algorithms**?

Good:

* Examples of algorithms in action on the Web, even on daily life
* Who's a social media addict unplugged activity
* > Algorithm shows a list of results based on a search

Maybe narrowed it down to much on search algorithms. 

##### Dean | What are **functions** and how do you use them?

Good: 

* Really nice presentation-page 
* Started with the theory and benefits of using functions

Can improve:

* Demo could have explained what the purpose of the function was before demoing it
* Didn't use unplugged computing...

##### Afsara & Malore | What are `if` statements (aka **conditionals**) and how do you use them?

Good:

* Intro explanation, nice video with Bill Gates
* Simple demo

Can improve:

* tripped up a bit on the variable
* no unplugged computing

##### Francisco & Ajay | What are **loops** and how do you use them?

Can improve:

* F demo a bit too fast
* no unplugged computing

##### Ben & Rosie | What is the **JavaScript Console** and how do you use it? 

Can improve:

* bit rushed explanation of the console.table
* other Console methods mentioned but right through heads 

##### Joe & Rajeev | What is the **GeoLocation** API and how do you use it?  

Good:

* Explained APIs first `What is an API?`
* Asked `What are interesting uses of geolocation?`
* > in 7 steps :)
* Demo: shared template + finished code 


## Week 3

### Notice a pattern?

Noticed several people had

```js
var resultsList = filterAndSortList(peopleList, chosenOption) 
var chosenOption = homeDropdown.val()
```

I must have explained it in a twisted way.

Maybe I should put number in the comment lines, eg:

```js
// 1. capture the user chosen option
```

### What happens when someone clicks on a result?

Many people didn't understand the `$('#results li').click` code had to be nested inside the function reacting to `homeGoButton.click`. [See Dean for instance](https://github.com/deanlc/apptemplate/commit/31d0e576d40f62dfcfeb9f32ed9d26463b3e1690#diff-77ab163850ef0fa98d6a9ee9fb6bbcafR51), who wasn't in class and used the gh tutorial to build his app.

Maybe put the whole, finished function on the gh tutorial? 

### Group interface variables?

```js
var interface = 
{
	home:
	{
		section: $('#home')
		// etc.
	}
}
```

### Refactoring

Functions like `showList` and `showDetails` are not really showing, but rather using a template to inject data in the DOM. Should be renamed... 

### Brainswarming

Try it on the wall? Easier to photograph...


## Week 4

### Squashing bugs

Next workshop could be about the debugging process:

1. Start with the Console <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>
* See if there are errors
* Examine the line(s) of code where the error originates
* Copy-paste the error on Google
* Raise an issue on GitHub
* Ask a question on StackOverflow
* Test solutions
* Share the working solution on Slack

**Common bugs**:

* `xyz is not defined`
* Permissions error
* anything else?

### Scraping data with Kimono

Could be a useful workshop, maybe for week 6 or 7.

Sources: Discogs, TagVenue, ResidentAdvisor...

### Advise for app ideas 

#### What's the angle?

Let's not make yet another serious app. Make a **parody** app instead.

You won't be able to compete with TripAdvisor, so why not present their data in a witty / unusual way?

#### Make a niche app

Don't make an app for everyone, make it *niche*.

#### Random generator

`A dance music finder for babies` to kickstart the ideation process.


## Week 4

### Peer-learning

#### Algorithms | Joe & Malore	

* Examples of algorithms in daily life
* Malore: maybe ask more questions, involve the audience
* Joe: great little game, distributed cards with numbers written on them to people. Then passed on the winning number for people to work out if they won or not. What was the algorithm? Compare given number with winning number, if they're the same you have won the game, otherwise pass the number to the next person.

#### Conditionals | Afsara & Rajeev

* Afsara: defined conditionals.. some examples could have been useful before the explanation
* Cool activity: given some real-life examples of algorithms, come up with a new example and fill in the `true` part of the statement, then pass it on to another group who will have to complete with the `else` part 

#### Debugging | Tom & Ajay

Ajay: starting with questions, eg what is a bug? what tools have we used to debug so far?
Tom: debugging in everyday life `Trying to get in my house  and I have 50 keys`. Process: identify the problem, then try out solutions (which you have searched for on Google / StackOverflow)
Nice one: debugging code examples in pairs

## Week 2

### Peer learning

* Make the groups and/or assign topics?

* [Objects of intense feeling](http://computationalculture.net/article/objects-of-intense-feeling-the-case-of-the-twitter-api) too long and hard to make sense of. Maybe give them only one section of it to research and comment on (3-4 minutes read).

### Tutorials

Didn't get time to do that..
