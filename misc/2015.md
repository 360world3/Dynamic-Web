# Making noise on the Web

The provisional plan:

1. [WTF are APIs](#apis) an [why do we use them](#abstraction)?
* Break the silence of the Web: [getting started with the Web Audio API](#the-Web-Audio-API)
* Build a musical instrument that you can play with your keyboard
* Data *sonification*: turn data into sound/noise so that it can *inform* you

Learning goals:

* Principles of (functional and OO) **programming**
* Understanding and using **APIs** (both data APIs and interaction APIs)
* **Information design**: how to turn raw data into something *informative*
* Having **fun** with code

Reading list:

* [The universe is programmable](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/the-universe-is-programmable/): the call for a standardised way of constructing a shared wealth of human knowledge (extending APIs and open-source methods to other fields of research). Is it a reductionist / deterministic view? 
* Functional programming + OO programming on Codecademy?



## APIs

So what's an API then? [Disambiguation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_(disambiguation))

**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface.

Something to do with programming applications.. an interface for programming applications?! 

### Interface?

What do we mean by *interface*? 

Something that stands between you and your goals. 

We're mostly familiar with graphical user interfaces, such as the icons you click to launch an app, send an email or even start the washing machine.

![](http://group.2008.gorenje.cc/en/imagelib/magnified/press/2013/germany/livinkitchen/gorenje_plus_lk/g-hob-a-gas-heaters.jpg)

Gas cookers have interfaces too: you don't operate the flame directly. The interface you use, the thing between you and the flame, are the *knobs* you push and turn.

### An interface to program applications?

> In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API expresses a software component in terms of its operations, *inputs*, *outputs*, and underlying types. [...] A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.

> From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)

An API **exposes** parts of a systems and **determines** how we (programmers) can interact with them to accomplish our (programming) goals. 

Not all parts of a system are exposed. Those which are exposed (programmable), have an API. 

An API tells us *which* parts of a system are exposed, and *how* we are allowed to tinker with them. 

A programming language can be understood as an API, in the sense that it's the tool between us and programming a computer. 

JavaScript is our API to a Web browser. If you want to display the square root of a number on a Web page, the browser can do the calculation for you, provided you ask nicely (ie, it allows you access to its computing functions, using the `Math` API, and more specifically the `Math.sqrt` function to do square roots operations). If you wanted to make the browser blow up your computer, there's no API for that. 


<!-- An API defines functionalities that are independent of their respective implementations, which allows definitions and implementations to vary without compromising the interface.

an API specifies a set of functions or routines that accomplish a specific task or are allowed to interact with a specific software component.-->


### An instruction manual?

> An API is essentially an *instruction manual* for a piece of software.

> From [The universe is programmable](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/the-universe-is-programmable/)

Well, the instruction manual is an important but not fundamental part of an API, just like the manual for an electric device can help you make the most of your new toy, but it's not *the thing*.

A good API comes with a thorough *documentation* (the instructions manual, also known as `docs` or `reference`), which explains what you have to send the code (input) and what it will spit back out (output). 

Without it, an API is unusable.

### A rule book?

An API has both a *dictionary* and a *rule book*: which actions you're allowed (and not allowed) to perform and how, which information you're allowed to ask and how often..

We can think of natural languages (English, Chinese, etc.) as APIs. 

For example, if we need directions from the Tour Eiffel to the Louvre, we can use the *French people's API* to ask for that information. 

Using its dictionary, we can get the building blocks of our request, which we piece together following the instructions of a decent grammar book. 

> Excusez-moi, comment puis-je marcher d'ici au Louvre?

The *French API* gives us several ways of expressing the same request (or **input**).

However, it doesn't tell us much about the response (or **output**). In fact, it doesn't even guarantee that we're going to get a response at all.

The French API is not as predictable as a Web browser's API.

Experience tells us that we would likely get a satisfying response to our question above, however we won't get a friendly response if we were to ask a stranger for personal information, even though the *French API* has no explicit ban for that.

> Excusez-moi, combien de fois avez-vous fait caca ce mois-ci?

<!--A **dictionary** is part of a natural language's API. But a language is more than a dictionary of words.-->

<!--
### Digital glue? 

> Think of an API as *digital glue* in the digital value chain, powering mobile and web apps, connecting disparate systems, and enabling innovation.

> From [APIs for dummies](http://media.wiley.com/assets/7255/37/9781118937228_custom.pdf), an introduction to APIs for business leaders crafted by APIGee, a company that builds and sells APIs.
-->




### A(nother) metaphor?

> In the Book of Genesis, God is the ultimate programmer, creating all of existence in a monster six-day hackathon.

<!--

* patterns, forms and behaviours are not explicitly programmed by the artist
* some behaviour cannot be predicted in advance

-->

> The API [...] is really one of the most profound metaphors of our time.

> From [The universe is programmable](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/the-universe-is-programmable/)

Reductionism. Can we reduce *everything* to an input-output machine? As we've seen with the *French API*, not all systems are deterministic (given an input we can determine the output).

Yet once you try framing "everything" around you as a set of APIs, you can start to understand the mindset of people in the *makers*, *open-source* or *hackers* communities: how they can see things around them as a set of programmable tasks, or usable sets of data and tools.

### A buzzword?

Just like many other fuzzy ideas (eg: money) there isn't a single definition, but rather many manifestations of the thing we call API.

Rather than ruminating over what APIs are, we can look at the benefit(s) of using them, or why it makes sense of framing our interactions with hardware, software, databases and services offered by other institutions (the Google APIs, the Facebook APIs etc) in terms of *application programming interfaces*.


### Abstraction

Using APIs, we don't have to write our programs in 0s and 1s.

> Being able to write **what** we want to do instead of **how** we do it means we are working at a higher level of abstraction. In practice, this means shorter, clearer, and more pleasant code.

From [Eloquent JavaScript: functional programming](http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter6.html#p75cea5d2d73e38c4)

## The Web Audio API

> The Web Audio API is a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesising audio in web applications. 

> From [Getting Started with Web Audio API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/)


<!--The goal of this API is to include capabilities found in modern game audio engines and some of the mixing, processing, and filtering tasks that are found in modern desktop audio production applications.-->

The metaphor behind this API is that you manipulate audio **nodes**, connecting **sources** to **destinations** with however many or little nodes in between.

![](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/diagrams/simple.png)

* Sources (inputs) can be generated audio, sound files, microphone streams. 

* The destination (output) is generally your headphones or speakers, but since the output is a stream of binary data we could convert it in all sorts of unconventional ways (starting from sound visualisation).

### Let's start making noise in the browser

Open up a Web browser (we'll use Chrome), on any page (better if you use a blank page `about:blank` so other scripts won't interfere with your noise-making fun).

Open the JavaScript Console: `View > Developer > JavaScript Console` or <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd>

#### [AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/AudioContext)

The first building block of the WebAudio API is `AudioContext`, which you can use to manage and play sound files.

In the Console, type:

```js
var a = new AudioContext()
```

#### [Oscillator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode) 

The quickest way for you to generate a sound is using an *oscillator*, which is not a sex toy. It's a special *node* that generates a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, aka a wave.

![](wave.png)

```js
var o = a.createOscillator()
```

To hear the sound it produces, you have to connect it to a *destination*. 

<!--`AudioContext` has a [default destination](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext/destination).-->

```js
o.connect(a.destination)
```

And then start it.

```js
o.start()
```

To change the sound **pitch**, modify the oscillator's `frequency` value.

```js
o.frequency.value = 100
```

##### Your turn

1. Try and set `o.frequency.value` to a different number. What happens?
* See if you can change the [type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode/type) of wave the oscillator produces.. (click the link to *read the manual* about that aspect of the Oscillator's API)
* How do you stop the oscillator? Well, [read the manual to find out](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode). And how do you start it again?
* How do you change the **volume**? This time, you may want to *google* your task and see what solutions you find.
