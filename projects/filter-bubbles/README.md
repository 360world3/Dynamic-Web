# Filter Bubbles

### This **team project** is about using *code* creatively to *curate content* produced by others.

<!-- (aka user-generated content) --> 

Pushing yourself out of your online comfort zone (aka *filter bubble*) you will discover how different communities use social media to craft their online identities. 

You will then produce a creative response that expresses your point(s) of view on what you observed. Whilst doing all that, you will get familiar with **JavaScript** libraries and **APIs**, and refresh your working knowledge of HTML and CSS.

The idea of [filter bubbles was proposed by Eli Pariser (watch this video)](http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?language=en#t-53082) to describe the effects of the "invisible algorithmic editing of the Web" by companies like Facebook and Google. As algorithms personalise content based on our preferences we are exposed only to what we *like*, and we don't get to see information that could challenge or broaden our worldview.

1. Form **teams of 2-3 people**.
* Define the **edges** of your team's bubbles.
* Research the **communities** at the extremities of your bubbles on social media.
* Create a **GitHub repository** for your team project (you may want to create a GitHub *organisation* for your team first). You will push all your contributions there: documentation, research, inspirations, code.
* Finalise your *idea*, narrow it, choose a direction / critical point.
* Create *algorithms* (one or more) that **pull in data** from one or more API sources. 
* Create *algorithms* (one or more) that **manipulate and visualise your data** to express your team views of the subculture(s). For example: create visualisations that reveal something unexpected, or that make us aware of some system or data you feel strongly about.
* Publish your project using **GitHub pages**. 

### Food for thought

* What is the intended or expected use of the API or the data you're obtaining, and how might you use it differently?

* What doesn't the API allow you to do, and how could you work around this? How could you "break" an API?

* How might you present data to influence the perspectives, actions and decisions of others?

* What are some unexpected or uncomfortable datasets we don't often think about?

* What is the most interesting data you can find? What is an unexpected way to experience it?

* How can you make your point(s) of view emerge without distorting the source data?

### Inspirations

* [Googling Freedom](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stml/sets/72157649456886632/) is a practical demonstration of a filter bubble

* [Selfie City](http://selfiecity.net/) investigates social media self-portraits in five cities across the world

* [FriendFlop](http://fffff.at/friendflop) is a browser extension for Chrome that scrambles the identities on your Twitter or Facebook timelines, dissolving your biases and "reminding you that everyone is saying the same shit anyway"

* [LoveMachine](http://p.xuv.be/tag/lovemachine) is a little app that clicks all the likes available in your timeline, automatically


### APIs, tutorials and tools

* [Instagram API how-to tutorial](https://github.com/robynitp/networkedmedia/wiki/Instagram-API-How-to)

* [InstaFeed.js](http://instafeedjs.com/) is a JS library you can use to pull data from Instagram (you may find it easier than using the [Instagram API](https://instagram.com/developer))

* [Kimono](http://builtwith.kimonolabs.com/) lets you turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds

* [Import.io](https://import.io/) is another service that lets you turn website data into API data

* [RAW](http://raw.densitydesign.org) allows you to convert spreadsheet data into a [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)-based visualisation 

* [Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega/) is a visualisation grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualisation designs.

- [ ] Starting list of hashtags? `#fakecation #gunporn` etc
- [ ] Open datasets: the [UK Government](http://data.gov.uk/data/search), [UniStats](https://unistats.direct.gov.uk/open-access-data/), others?
