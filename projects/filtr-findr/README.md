### Make an **app** that helps **people** sort through **data** to **find** who/what they are looking for.

**The *who/what* is up to you**. People may be looking for other people in their community to do something together, or they may be looking for food recipes, places to go, books to read, films to watch.. 

No matter which data the app uses, its (initial) **logic** will be:

1. **Load data** from an online database 
* Capture **user inputs**, when they click on buttons, type into text boxes or choose from a dropdown menu etc.
* **Sort data** according to user choices, for instance filtering out data that doesn't match their choices
* Present a human-readable **output** 


# Roadmap

In class we will demo how to build an example app, which we call the `app template`. This will happen during the first three weeks. You will then use the `app template` to build *your own* app, based on your own idea, and iterate that through the rest of the unit. 

> You can find all the source code for the `app template` [here](app-template).

* 7th of October, project start
	* [ ] Workshop: HTML + CSS (aka the *interface*) for the `app template`
	* [ ] Create a GitHub repository for your project
