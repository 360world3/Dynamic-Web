### Make an **app** that helps **people** sort through **data** to **find** who/what they are looking for.

**The *who/what* is up to you**. People may be looking for other people in their community to do something together, or they may be looking for food recipes, places to go, books to read, films to watch.. 

No matter which data the app uses, its **logic** will be the same:

1. **Load data** from an online database 
* Capture **user inputs**, when they click on buttons, type into text boxes or choose from a dropdown menu etc.
* **Sort data** according to user choices, for instance filtering out data that doesn't match their choices
* Present a human-readable **output**
