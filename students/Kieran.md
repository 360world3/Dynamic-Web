### Whatever The Weather

This is an application based on our filter bubble idea to allow users to find places around them based on their location. The places that they find will be able to give them a varied list of places that they will be able to choose from. The idea of this is so that they can try out some new places and try to explore outside of their filter bubble in the real world.
