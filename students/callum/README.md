##Introduction
My app idea came from when we practised Brain-swarming. I wanted to make some kind of music app that helps the user make a decision. My initial idea was a non serious app that takes what music the user is listening to and then tells them about their taste in music, either by judging ratings or popularity of the song, this could be in a humours way such as “Your music taste is shit.” After brainstorming some more ideas based on the music idea and looking at what you can do with music APIs, I finally came up with an idea that I wanted to make. The app will have ask the user a series of questions that could change when the app is reloaded, the questions will not be about music taste but will ask questions related to their lives, such as “what is your favourite colour?” and the answers to these (3) questions will generate a playlist of songs for the user to listen too.

##Research
Who is this app for?

People who listen to music.

What are they achieving with it?

Discovering new music in a unique way

How and where are they using this app?

App asks users questions about themselves takes the answers and searches for an album from Spotify.

Why would they not use competition (radio/other apps) instead?

This app uses spotify api to search their database of tracks but they are not searching for genres/artists/etc in the usual way, which people might get bored of and not fid any new music this is an interesting way of discovering new albums to listen too.

Are there other apps you find inspiring/relevant? Put links and images/screenshots aplenty

Soundcloud and Spotify. I use Soundcloud for looking for new music, mostly by looking at what my friends have been listening too and what they like, this is shown on the feed on the homepage, this made me think I would like to include some way to recommend music from my app. Youtube’s personal music feed is very interesting for finding music also. It picks a song you have recently listened too and creates playlists that continually refresh with new related music. They also suggest playlists for mood and activities.


##App Store Description

WAYLT (Who Are You Listening To, pronounced WALT) is a music discovery app where WAYLT asks you a few personal questions and then generates n album for YOU. Try it out, answer three easy questions about yourself and then just listen, if you like what you get you can keep answering questions to receive more albums that are tailored to you.

##Process

####How does your app currently work?

The app asks the user 3 personal questions that I chose because I thought they would give interesting answers. (1.) The user submits the answers and one of them is picked at random, that answers is then included in a YQL search using the spotify API to search for 10 albums. (2.) 1 of the albums is picked at random and the Name and Artists are displayed to the user to then listen too.
(3.)

####Is your idea changed since you started developing it?
I tried to have the YQL search for a track or a playlist not an album but could not get the code to work. 
What can you realistically achieve before the deadline?
              The app is fully functional but there are still other features that could be included.
              
####What were your learning goals at the beginning of the unit? 
Learning to use Javascript and get more comfortable with coding.

####What have you learned?
I have learnt how to use APIs, how JavaScript works and using HTML, CSS and JavaScript together to build an app. 
What obstacles have you found?
You cant always get the completed product you want at the start and have to work ways around this. Finding out answer to a problem with coding online is difficult it takes a lot of trying and failing and learning how code works to solve the problem.

####How did you go about solving the problems you encountered?
I looked back on projects and excerises I had done and tried to use those skills to solves the problem and then searched online for answers to questions as well as read tutorials and examples on using Javascript and APIs.

####What do you think you could improve in your app?
There could be more questions and they could alternate every time the app is refreshed.  The query at the moment only searches for albums that include the words from the users answers, this could be improved by searching for similar words or synonyms as this would give less obvious answers and I feel would make the app more interesting.
The app could search for the chosen album on YouTube or Spotify and then play it or display a link.


####What do you think you could improve in your skills (research,design, development, time management..)?
My knowledge of coding could be improved but I feel it is slowly getting better.
