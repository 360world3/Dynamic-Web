# WEB14203: Dynamic Web #
### Akvile Petrauskaite ###

## Introduction ##
For this project my goal is to create an app which will help people find comic book stores in their local areas. Below I have linked all the different parts of this project that all come together to form my app, showing my steps and sketches of how I got there within my blog posts and the app itself on GitHub pages.

I've decided to show my progress of the app in my blog posts while also talking about some of the issues that I had along the way and keeping this document clean and simple.

### Summative Presentation ###
Here is the link for my [summative presentation](http://slides.com/akvilepetrauskaite/deck-3/fullscreen "summative presentation"). This is my final presentation for this project, which includes my steps of what my app is, how I have worked on it along the way, and my improvements for the future for the app.
