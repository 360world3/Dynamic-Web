##Introduction

####Personal Introduction
#####Who is Afsara Begum? Why you choosing to make this app?

As a British Bangladeshi my social life consisted of going to a lot of asian weddings. These asian weddings were a repeat of wearing sarees to the same venues over and over again! I gathered people either couldn't find any special venues in London or they wanted to be cheap and pick the same venue as every other person. As I discovered a problem I thought this project was the perfect opportunity to create an app which can solve it! 

More of my personal revelation can be found in my 'Significant moments of my wedding app' blog below.

####Brief

The brief that I received for the Dynamic Web term is **"To make an app which helps people to sort through data to find out what they are looking for"**. I have chosen to make an app which allows users to find wedding venues around London depending on area and price, in addition it allows users to find other wedding services around their desired location. 

To find out more of my app idea you can look at the different links below to see how I got my idea and look at my actual wedding app. Furthermore other work that I completed during this past term has been linked below such as my blogs and summative presentation.

##Wedding app


####Earlier stages..


I was able to show my app and receive feedback at an earlier stage of the process in the formative. You can check the [formative presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xbC_npv08x276q-Dn6rdFcmkK_hsbKpFMbA8_HGlfVw/edit?usp=sharing) to get an understanding of the growth of my app.

After the formative presentation I created [wireframes](https://app.moqups.com/afsara.begum@students.rave.ac.uk/EqfFjkHo8U/view/page/ad2522a63) from the earlier sketches I made on the formative presentation. This is so that I keep focus on the functions I want to keep on my app. 


####Later stages and production of app...

#####Data


Using Thimble Projects I was able to create a firebase "pusher" to push data into a database data. I have 2 types of filters for my project which are venues and services, therefore I would need to make 2 data pushers.

* [Venue Pusher](https://thimbleprojects.org/afsara/126865/)
* [Services Pusher](https://thimbleprojects.org/afsara/131500/)

After creating the pushers I found data in my [firebase database](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/venue-df51c/database/data/). Following this I was able to connect this firebase into my actual app.

####Actual App

My actual app is uploaded onto [github](https://github.com/afsarabegum/wedding). Here you will be able to see the journey and codes that I used to create this app. This then generates the [url](https://afsarabegum.github.io/wedding/).

##Summative Presentation


The [summative presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gC2MOXxChaCUWYpvNKk5_B8Sqv7eUs6ek1ZTRqGr9pw/edit?usp=sharing) is the last stage of this project. I created my presentation on Google Slides similarly to the formative presentation. In the presentation I included secondary research, competitors, sketches, wireframes and screenshots of progression of the website.
