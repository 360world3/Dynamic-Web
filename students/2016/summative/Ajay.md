### Introduction

This document will lead you through my project on creating a web app that will allow you to search for past and present Hiphop and R&b songs. The web app will have different filters to allow you to find a specific era of songs. This document will hold all the links to the work that I have done through this project.

##### Formative Presentation
Below is a link of a Powerpoint presentation for the Formative explaining what I had done half way through the project.

##### Summative Presentation
Below you will find the link to my summative presentation which I completed online using google slides. It will have a break down of what my project is about, who my target audience is and what it will look like. Additionally, you will find the sketches for my app, wireframes, and my old thimble template. Further down this document you will find the link to my current Thimble form and see the changes that I've made.

#####Thimble and Firebase

Here are the two links to the Firebase database, and the thimble form. The database holds all the information the web app will provide, for example the albums. The Thimble is the form that I've created with the relevant fields to add the information to the database.

#####Wireframes and Sketches

I will also be adding links to my sketches and wireframes for review as they where a main part of my project. They allowed me to put my ideas down on paper and see them visually. By doing this I was able to look back at them when I was designing the app.
