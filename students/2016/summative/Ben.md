##Introduction

When we first got told about this project, I was very intrigued and excited. I did not have a clear idea of what I wanted produce into an app and went through a couple of ideas, but eventually found one that worked well. 

My initial idea was to have an app that lets the user discover a certain type of restaurant near them. After the brain-swarming exercise we did as a class, I felt my idea was not as exciting and unique as others. After thinking and researching I decided to create an app to do with finding sport venues determined by location. Sport is something I am passionate about, which meant I would be more determined to create an app that was professional and unique. 

The final app idea I have researched and produces is finding a unique sport, such as Foot Golf and Zorb football and showing where they are located. There will be an section about the venue in the details page and a link to their website.
