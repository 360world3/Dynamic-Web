##Dynamic web Summative hand-in package
The brief for this unit is to ‘make an app that helps people sort through data to find who/what they are looking for’ and as I work part-time in a popular mother and baby store, I have decided to create an app that helps parents find the right product for themselves and their children.

To start this project, we first had to create a database to store all the information to serve to our users through the app. I had decided to split my data units (the products) by category. I ended up with 9 categories, which suddenly seemed like quite a tall order. So I then decided to cut it down to just Pushchairs and Car Seats. I did this because these are the two most daunting products to consider for new parents, they are the products I sell most on the most whilst at work, and I know the most about these compared to other departments in my store, and finally it makes it easier for me to think about branding when it’s just two types of products on offer.

Now that I had narrowed down my categories and created a more niche idea, I needed to create my database. To do this, in class we created a [Firebase database](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/new-parent-app/), and a [pusher]((https://thimbleprojects.org/wwwtf/119390/)) to push our data into it. I had trouble getting my pusher to work, but after collaborating with my classmates we managed to get it working for everyone. For each entry, I need 9 pieces of information. These were: name, category (pushchair or car seat), a quick overview of the product, an image, price, ‘suitable from’ age, list of retailers, average star rating, and a review from a trusted expert. 

The next step, after populating my database, was to think about how I wanted my app to look. I wanted to keep the interface simple and plain, to take the focus away from the design to focus more on the products. I decided to have 4 options on the home screen, one for searching by product type, one for searching by child’s age, a search by product name, and a ‘view my favourites’ option.


The results page I wanted to keep plain again, with a small image of the product on the left hand side and then a field stating the name of the product, the price and a sentence giving an overview of the product, when the image is clicked, a more detailed section will open up displaying all of the information I included in my database.


I have translated this into code and published it on [Github pages](https://rosiebuddell.github.io/newparentapp/).
