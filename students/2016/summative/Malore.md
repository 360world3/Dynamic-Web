This is the link to my summative presentation which I did on Google Slides. I tried to include everything that was on the list of what should be included. As I used the same Slides document for my formative presentation and summative, I can not upload a link for my formative. However I did upload a YouTube video of me presenting my formative so I will leave the link for that as well. I made a video of this as I was unable to attend the lesson. I have also included my peer learning presentation that me and another classmate made. I did other peer learning lessons but they were all interactive and didn't involve any presentations. 


##GitHub

GitHub is where all the code for my app is kept. Its the best place to keep it as it is all together in one place and is accessible for anybody to see. Even though everyone seems to use Source Tree, I find the GitHub Desktop app easier to use. I never fully figured out how it works and the Github one has a much easier setup and include fewer steps to push data on to GitHub. Below is the links to my App Web page on GitHub and also all my code.

##Firebase & Thimble

I used the programmes Firebase and Thimble to produce the database for my app. These are the ones that was suggested for us to use. When I first started using them I found them very confusing and quite a few problems occurred, but now I have used them more I have realised that they're a lot more simple than I first thought. Below I will link my Firebase and Thimble pages.

##Blog Posts

Each week we are given a different blog that we have to do. They normally have some similarity to what we had learned and talked about during that days lesson. I do my blogs on Medium as this is what I have always used to do my blogs. I like using this as it is very simple to use and all the functions are clear too. It also allows you to group different stories together in to a 'publication'. I use this as it makes it easier for me to find the certain blog I am after. It also makes my Medium profile look a lot tidier. First I will link the publication for this course and then my blogs individually.
