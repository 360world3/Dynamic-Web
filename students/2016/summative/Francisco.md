# WEB14203 The Dynamic Web

###The main purpose of this subject is to learn how to mash up Web technologies to make tools (aka apps) that everyone can use.

By the end of this course, we will be able to:

- Create proof-of-concept functional prototypes for Web applications, which manipulate data from online database(s) and/or API(s).
- Analyse the mechanics of a Web application, breaking down its behaviour into data, functions and logic.
- Understand the role of the three pillar technologies of the Web: HTML, CSS and JS.
- Research and use interaction APIs (aka code libraries like jQuery) and integrate them in your project.
- Understand how data APIs function (HTTP requests, API keys, URL parameters etc.) and hook up one or more APIs to your Web application.
- Apply your understanding and experiment on your own: refine, test and debug your code.
- Feel confident searching for solutions to design challenges and coding issues.
- Look critically at APIs as communication protocols that are made and enforced by people: what does an API allow you to do, what does it not, who should be able to use it and why, are some of the questions you will seek to answer.
- Document your design and development process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including successes and failures.
- Communicate your ideas both technically and in an engaging way.

## Summative Presentation

My main task was to make an app that helps people find what/who they're looking for through data.

The logic is the following:

- Load data from an online database
- Capture user inputs, when they click on buttons, type into text boxes or choose from a dropdown menu etc.
- Sort data according to user choices, for instance filtering out data that doesn't match their choices
- Present a human-readable output

## Blogs

The following blogs were done based on what I've learned as a student so far. It allowed me to explore different topics and therefore expand my knowledge in terms of constructing my ideas better and developing them in a careful way, after going through several steps. It gave me more confidence to challenge myself, to make my own opinions and take them forward.
