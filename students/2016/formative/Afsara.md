# WEB14203: Dynamic Web

**Name:** Afsara Begum

**Student No:** 96295215

**Course:** BA (Hons) Web Media, Level 2.

**Unit Code:** WEB14203

##Introduction
The brief that I received for the Dynamic Web term is to make an app which helps people to sort through data to find out what they are looking for. I have chosen to make a wedding app which allows users to find wedding venues depending on which area in London and how expensive it is. To find out more of my app idea you can look at my formative presentation and code on github pages.
