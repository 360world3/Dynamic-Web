This document will lead you to my current project on creating a web app that will allow you to search for past and present Hiphop and R&b songs. The web app will have different filters to allow you to find a specific era of songs. This document will hold all the links to the work that I have done through this term.

Below is a link of a Powerpoint presentation explaining what I have done so far for this project.

Finally, here are the two links to the Firebase database, and the thimble form. The database holds all the information the web app will provide and the thimble document contains the form in which I uploaded the data.
