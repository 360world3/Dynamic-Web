# WEB14203: Dynamic Web #
### Akvile Petrauskaite ###

## Introduction ##
For this project my goal is to create an app which will help people find comic book stores in their local areas. Below I have linked all the different parts of this project that all come together to form my app, showing my steps and sketches of how I got there, my blog posts and the app itself on GitHub pages.

### Formative Presentation ###
Here is the link to my [formative presentation](http://slides.com/akvilepetrauskaite/deck-3/fullscreen "Formative Presentation") that I presented in class showing my app idea and progress. For my progress I added some sketches to my presentation showing my steps of development towards the content and display of my app.

Here is the link for my app on [gh-pages](https://aiharachan.github.io/ComicFindr/) and the link to my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aiharachan/ComicFindr).

This is the link to my Thimble [Firebase form](https://thimbleprojects.org/aiharachan/127440/). Note that the form does not currently submit as it has an error which I am working on fixing and the link to the remixed version will change in the future.
