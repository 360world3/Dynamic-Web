# App Description #

Time Killer is a great new app with the purpose of solving an age old problem, what to do with your spare time?

Simply provide us with the answers to a couple of questions and this clever app will suggest the way in which you should kill your time. 

Whether you have more than 30 minutes of time to kill or as little as a few minutes, this app will give you the solution you need with hundreds of ways (only 14 currently) to kill that time.

Even if the suggestion we make isn’t quite for you, it’s easy enough to select the option to try again for another ‘Time Killer’, or answer the questions differently for even more suggestions.

# How does it work? #

Time Killer works on the basis of you providing answers to 3 questions: How much time do you want to kill, How do you feel and What's the weather like. Using these answers, the app can manipulate the data within a database to filter a list of activities and eventually show a random activity that corresponds to the answers provided. If the user feels satisfied with the end result they can carry on with their day, knowing how to kill their time; if not the user can instead select the option to answer the questions again and the possible activities can be filtered again for a different end result.
