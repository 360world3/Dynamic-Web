## Introduction 

#### Filter Bubbles

This team project is about using code creatively to curate content produced by others.

Pushing yourself out of your online comfort zone (aka filter bubble) you will discover how different communities use social media to craft their online identities.

You will then produce a creative response that expresses your point(s) of view on what you observed. Whilst doing all that, you will get familiar with JavaScript libraries and APIs, and refresh your working knowledge of HTML and CSS.
