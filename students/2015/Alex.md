### Introduction

TweetHeat is a collaborative project and an attempt at creating an application allowing users to find & analyse the impact of their tweets. We aim to create the possibility for businesses to analyse what social media marketing techniques work and those impacting their possible growth. Aiming this at start-ups and businesses not able to spend money on larger companies offering a similar service

##### Research

After research and realising that multiple versions of this idea are already hitting this niche market, we attempted to analyse our USP, or what would set us apart from the already large companies. We were able to establish a couple of already strong sectors;
The depth the tweet is analysed from - seeing more than its location and composition could give better insight 
The location of tweets - would allow for more targeted marketing 
The sentiment of the tweet - giving ability to understand if the tweets are generally positive or negative 

We then attempted to see where we could improve and what else we could offer to businesses in search of growth, these include;
The affect of mass tweeting or marketing campaigns on users - potentially analysing amount of retweets, shares and clicks (if link exists)
The timing of tweets for mass impact - you wouldn't want to spend money marketing to the US and hit them on socials while their all sleeping.
Location spread - by this i mean distance a tweet will travel, amount of unique visitors and also potential conversion rate of unique visitors to users. 
High activity locations - businesses would be interested in insight into where their product/offer is best received and IF this has a direct correlation with their marketing strategy or does is show anomalies that should be identified and worked on.
Overall we believe that TweetHeat would offer valuable insight for businesses attempting to re-vamp, re-gain control of and have a better impact online. 


**The aims of TweetHeat**

- Create insight into a social media marketing campaign and it's direct affect on the public
- Create high visual representation of a businesses tweets - allows for better understanding and can lead to pivots within the business if a better technique, timing, content is established. 
- Home down to specifics such as age or gender if attempting to hit a niche market

We also thought a report based system would be useful in future where businesses could create  curated list of analytics they are interested in i.e gender + positive/negative balance + location. This would give us the ability to analyse and offer suggestions into how to engage better with that specific age group or analyse which age groups respond best and the if there is any correlation with their location, if they are influenced by peers and how far information travels.

## Inspiration links
My favourite version of what we are trying to create is [here](http://onemilliontweetmap.com)
They have built using [maptimize](http://v3.maptimize.com)
They also use elasticsearch framework that I don't know enough about to comment on but charge crazy amounts of money to use their [service](http://elasticsearch-plugin.maptimize.com)

*Exploring the edges of my filter bubble*
I designed the below and tried to figure out where our filter bubble edges were, our influences are how everything is curated towards the user. I found intelligent mobile matchmaking or IM3 tech to really wow me and have spent time reading [this](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SJpc_oFh_HMC&pg=PA268&lpg=PA268&dq=intelligent+mobile+matchmaking+im3&source=bl&ots=DnfKslt35b&sig=yKYC18KYAXEHczZ_befWq4FyjrE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlsd-ymMDJAhUEHD4KHeTTAQYQ6AEILDAC)

## Sketches


## Broken code
The first attempt at coding TweetHeat was attempted through Python and tutorials were followed and allegedly copied. 
Another tutorial was found online and this one used AWS and node.js to GET request its info. A twitter app was also created (that was easy) to get the right access codes and Auth. token to pull the data from. 
Code is visible [here](https://github.com/arfarmery/twitter-heat-nodejs-master)

## Working code
In the end after pulling most of my hair out the 'app' would still not run. We tried focusing our efforts on location based tweets as this would back up our idea for a map allowing users to visualise their data - would also aid during a pitch where one would be trying to show how a businesses tweets are impacting their clients. 
The code did NOT work in the end and we probably deserve this since we tried to copy another humans project. I did however manage to locally host the code, play with the css - however the javascript search queries did not successfully work out. oh well - have to learn someway

### Summative Presentation

Presentation was done in keynote. Attempt at anaylising our market, entry into the market, what businesses would use Tweetheat and explanation of how it should supposedly function
