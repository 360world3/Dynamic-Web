This will be the main logo for my app, Chocolate Decider!!! Everyone loves chocolates, sometimes you get to a point in life where you can’t pick which chocolate to eat. Yes its difficult I know but dont worry this app will make life easier for you.



Bounty, Galaxy or Dairy Milk? Dont stress out your brain my app will give you an ideal chocolate to eat, all you have to is just answer 2 questions.

Any dietary requirements? I can’t eat nuts ☹

Whats your mood at the moment ? ☺:/ :s ☹ 'I'm confused' 

I tried to add a lot of color onto my logo as it will catch peoples attention and chocolate takes your attention away from everything. Its an fun app as its chocolate not anything serious like coffee. It makes you go crazy, hyper and takes all your unhappiness away.

This is a small preview of what my app looks like. 

#How does my app work

1.) Open up the app and it will tell you to 'Answer a set of questions, so we can give you an ideal chocolate to eat'. You will have to click the 'Go' button to get going. 

2.)It will then ask you 'what are you allergic to?' You can select if your allergic to anything, if not just click to the 'Next' button

3.)Thirdly it will ask 'Whats your mood at the moment?' You will then have to select your mood and click the 'next' button. 

4.) Finally your chocolate!!, your chocolate will appear. A message will come up on the final page saying you should eat 'kit kat chunky'(for this case)
