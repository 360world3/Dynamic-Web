# mood

__Well, what is it?__

*Good question sir!*

__I know, that's why I asked.__

*Mood is an application that forcefully helps people figure out what mood they should be in that day.*

__That's pure genius!  So how does it work?__

*The app works with the use of 3 APIs (Application Programming Interface) which have been linked together in such a way that it could make an educated prediction of what mood the user could be in.  Firstly it uses 
	<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp" title="Title">
	Geolocation</a> 
to discover the whereabouts of the user.  Secondly, it uses a weather API called 
	<a href="http://openweathermap.org/api" title="Title">
	OpenWeatherMap</a> 
 which can figure out what the weather is like in conjunction with where they are located.  Finally, it looks at the id number of the weather type currently active and connects to a spreadsheet database of emotions.  Each weather type is linked to three different moods and it will select one of the three to display as the users result.*

__But how is the weather supposed to predict someones mood?__



<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/14/climate-health_n_4568505.html" title="Title">Studies</a>
 *show that the weather can have an impact on a persons mood.  Higher temperatures can have a postive affect on a depressed person, as well as 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder" title="Title">SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder)</a>
  giving people major depression periods during certain seasons, most noteably during autumn and winter.  So by looking at the weather in the users area the app can predict what sort of mood the person will be in. Obviously a little more than the weather impacts peoples moods but this app is only for __entertainment__ purposes.  The users are never told the results are based on the weather. They are given a spiral to stare at which supposedly 'scans' them and then they believe the result to be personal to them.*

__Marvellous! Good old fashioned trickery to make people believe that it is magic not science.__

*It is also slightly magic.*

__Good lord!  Really?  Well I certainly am impressed.  Well done boy, very well done!__

*Here is what the user journey looks like!*

*And here is some Javascript code that is making it work!*
