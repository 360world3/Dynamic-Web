# Week 9

### Today, Thursday 19th November 2015

1. [Stand up](#stand-up)
* Tutorials on [*Filter Bubbles*](#team-project)


# Stand up

We'll start the day with a stand-up meeting, also known as **the huddle**.

It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.

> The discomfort of standing for long periods is intended to keep the meetings short.

Each team will answer **3 questions**:

1. What did we accomplish **last week**?
* What will we do **this week**?
* What **obstacles** are impeding our progress?

We won't discuss these obstacles in details. The idea is to **identify obstacles** (some may be shared by various teams), and tackle those later in follow-up meetings.

Many companies (start-ups in particular) do daily stand-ups as a way to get an overview of what everyone is doing and plan the day ahead. 

The better you become at summarising what you're working on and asking for help without faffing around with unnecessary details, the better suited you will be for your next job.


# Team project

The **final deadline** is next week. 

Between now and next week, your **team** should:

* Download and use the [**Productivity Planner**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0FP625GojKHRlJRZWQ4cjVvSFk).
* Agree on a **shared list** of what's **to do** (see [tips above](#the-way-you-write-your-task-can-dictate-whether-it-will-get-done)).
* Assign tasks to team members, so that you know **who does what and when**. Discuss how much time each task may take, how much time each of you have and who's going to be affected if a task is not completed in time.
* **Work** on the agreed tasks <sup>OBVIOUSLY
* **Track** the time you spend on each task. You could use the [Harvest app](https://www.getharvest.com) for that.
