# Workshop

### Why a *database* in the *cloud*?

Writing **server-side** code can be hard. 

Maintaining a server-side infrastructure can be even harder.

A standard scenario:

* You would create a MySQL database.
* You may have a PHP class that is responsible for performing CRUD operations. Optionally, you could just have a bunch of PHP functions.
* You may use JavaScript and Ajax on the client-side to call the respective PHP scripts and pass in query strings.
* You would need to sanitise the input to protect against XSS attacks, as well as worry about database security in general.
* If a collaborative app, you would need to track different users and manage their lists. More code, more tables, and more schemas.
* You would need to make sure your database stays performant.

Parse is a *database-as-a-service* platform, owned by Facebook.

Instead of building and maintaining your own server-side stack, you can use Parse.

> Focus on creating a beautiful end-user experience and let Parse take care of the rest.

Parse is not the only cloud database service. [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com) (owned by Google) is another one. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) offer various db solutions. Learn more about cloud databases [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_database).

### All together now

1. Go to [parse.com](https://parse.com) and sign up for a free account. 
* The signup process will guide you through the creation of an *app*.

	![](assets/parse-new-app.png)

* Go to [Parse's quick-start page](https://parse.com/apps/quickstart) and choose `Data` > `Web` > `New project`. This will download a folder.
* Open the downloaded folder in a code editor.
* Notice the two scripts in the `head` of `index.html`

	```html
	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.parsecdn.com/js/parse-latest.js"></script>
  ```
  
  jQuery and the Parse JavaScript SDK (**S**oftware **D**evelopment **K**it).
* Just before the end of the `body`, there's a `script` in which Parse is initialised.

	```js
	Parse.initialize("APPLICATION_ID", "JAVASCRIPT_KEY")
	```
	
	Change `APPLICATION_ID` to your app's id and `JAVASCRIPT_KEY` to your app's JS key. You can find those in your app > `Settings` > `Keys`
	
	![](assets/parse-keys.jpg)
* Test the app in your browser.	
* Go to your Parse app and click on `Core`.

	If you didn't get an error in the previous step, you should see there's a new row in the `TestObject` table, something like this
	
	![](assets/parse-table.png)
	
	What happened?
	
	Back to the code editor, notice how the `TestObject` *class* was created
	
	```js
	var TestObject = Parse.Object.extend("TestObject")
	```
	
	Then a new *instance* of that class was made
	
	```js
	var testObject = new TestObject()
	```
	
	And finally the *data object* `{foo: "bar"}` was saved
	
	```js
	testObject.save({foo: "bar"}, 
	{
		...
	})
	```	

	With two function to handle the `success` and `error` scenarios.
  
This is Parse in a nutshell. Now go to their [JavaScript Guide](https://parse.com/docs/js/guide#getting-started) and see what other things you can do with Parse.  

* In particular, [Objects](https://parse.com/docs/js/guide#objects) are rather fundamental, as well as [Queries](https://parse.com/docs/js/guide#queries).

* If your app is **location-based**, you should check out [GeoPoints](https://parse.com/docs/js/guide#geopoints).

* If you want to build a **user-base**, then [Users](https://parse.com/docs/js/guide#users) may be very useful to you.

* If you want to let your users upload **files**, then [Files](https://parse.com/docs/js/guide#files) are what you need.

### What could **you** build with Parse?

Let's brainstorm a few ideas. These can be based on your *Filter Bubbles* projects, completely unrelated to them, or anything in between.

# What have *tomatoes* got to do with *productivity*?

Behavioural economists have talked at length about *ego-depletion*, which means that human beings have a limited amount of decision-making ability in each day. 

>  The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.

> Steven Covey

To be productive, you want to focus on the **main task of the day** first, before you start getting distracted with {insert your distraction of choice here, including emails}.

### How to decide on the **main** thing?

> If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?

Write down the **3-5 things, and no more** that are making you most anxious or uncomfortable. 

<!--  most important = usually most uncomfortable/most procrastinated upon -->

###  The way you write your task can dictate whether it will get done

Is this **concrete**? 

Is it clearly **actionable**? 

Is there any *ambiguity* about how to **get started**?

### Back to tomatoes..

The *Pomodoro* (Italian for tomato) TechniqueÂ® gets its name from a tomato-shaped timer that its founder, Francesco Cirillo, first used to combat his procrastination.

1. Decide on a clear task that you want to focus on that will take you at least **25 minutes** to do. 
* Start a timer for 25 minutes and start working on the task. This time block is known as a *Pomodoro*. It is an indivisible unit of time. You can never do halfa *Pomodoro*. Do not work on anything else. If you get distracted, gently bring yourself back to work.It happens. Relax. If your distraction pulls you away from the task at hand, cancel the *Pomodoro* by resetting the timer to zero. * Once the timer ends, time for a mini-celebration! Get up, stretch, get some more water, do a happy dance. You have **5 minutes of break** time until you start the next *Pomodoro*.

# Team project

![](../../projects/filter-bubbles/assets/junk-food-analogy.png)

### Filter Bubbles tutorials

This **team project** is about pushing yourself out of your online comfort zone (aka *filter bubble*) to observe different communities and express your points of view through code.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/filter-bubbles).

### 6 teams

### 20 minutes per team


# Homework

### Work on Filter Bubbles

The **final deadline** is in two week's time and next week will be the last tutorial. 

Between now and next week, your **team** should:

* Download and use the [**Productivity Planner**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0FP625GojKHRlJRZWQ4cjVvSFk).
* Agree on a **shared list** of what's **to do** (see [tips above](#the-way-you-write-your-task-can-dictate-whether-it-will-get-done)).
* Assign tasks to team members, so that you know **who does what and when**. Discuss how much time each task may take, how much time each of you have and who's going to be affected if a task is not completed in time.
* **Work** on the agreed tasks <sup>OBVIOUSLY
* **Track** the time you spend on each task. You could use the [Harvest app](https://www.getharvest.com) for that.

### Stand-up

Next week we'll start the day with a stand-up meeting, also known as **the huddle**.

It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.

> The discomfort of standing for long periods is intended to keep the meetings short.

Each team will answer **3 questions**:

1. What did we accomplish **last week**?
* What will we do **this week**?
* What **obstacles** are impeding our progress?

We won't discuss these obstacles in details. The idea is to **identify obstacles** (some may be shared by various teams), and tackle those later in follow-up meetings.

Many companies (start-ups in particular) do daily stand-ups as a way to get an overview of what everyone is doing and plan the day ahead. 

The better you become at summarising what you're working on and asking for help without faffing around with unnecessary details, the better suited you will be for your next job.

### Blog 

Write notes about the *challenges* you encountered in planning and executing your **team work**.

Some questions that may guide your writing:

* How is your team **organised**? Is there an appointed *leader*? Are there defined *roles*?
* What **tools** are you using to collaborate? Any tips for making these tools work for your team?
* How do you **decide** on ideas and solutions to pursue?
* How do you go about solving **conflicts**? 

Btw, these are all questions that you will be asked in future **job interviews**, so thinking about these aspect of your work and practicing answering those questions is rather important.
