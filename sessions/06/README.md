# Challenge

Remember the [HTML5 Geolocation API](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=HTML5+Geolocation+API)?

Using your *Google search super-powers*, find out how to use that API to:

* Geolocate the (anonymous) user of your app and store their coordinates (`latitude` and `longitude`) in variables.  
* Use `latitude` and `longitude` to plot a marker on the map. 
* The user marker should look different from the other markers.
* The user marker should change position as the user moves.

<!--
```js
if (dataItem.free) div.className = 'marker free'
else div.className = 'marker paid'
```

# Homework

### Project

Work on [*Filtr Findr*](../../projects/filtr-findr) as planned in [your tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EhDq-ly8zI0UmBy83ZzOyYXjSjiu77nBVCTj6yBtZaE/edit#heading=h.2ruq2spchq1t).

### Codewars katas

Complete at least 2 challenges (aka *katas*) on the beginner levels (aka *8 kyu* or *7 kyu*).

### Blog 

Think of **significant moments** in the life of your app project so far and jot them down as a list (or as a *timeline* if you prefer). These could be things like `Brainswarming: first idea`, `Talked about first idea with flatmate: changed target`, `Researched similar apps online: no competition` etc. 

Then **pick one** of these moments, and blog about what happened in that moment. Record the **story of that moment** as you would tell it to a friend, not as an academic paper. 

Reflect on the **lesson(s)** you have learned from that moment.
