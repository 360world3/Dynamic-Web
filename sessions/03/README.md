# What is an app?

Let's sketch a **working definition** of *app*.

How do you explain what an app is to someone or something who's never seen/used one, like an *alien*?

* What does an app **look like**?  
* How do you **interact** with an app? Do you speak to it, do you shake it etc?
* What are apps **made out of**?
* **Who uses** apps? Why?

### What is an app, then?

There is no clear-cut definition of *app*.

For the sake of this course, we like to think of apps as small **digital tools** that are **connected** to the Web.

To use an analogy, if a website is like a *book*, which you use to find and consume information, an app is closer to a *whisk*, which you use to make something with.

Apps generally have a specific function, or a small set of functions. They are not trying to do everything.

This is *not* a good app. It is not **usable**, even though all the tools it features could be usable (and possibly useful) on their own.

Good apps do **one thing** and do it well.

## Key concepts

### Interface

The parts of the app you directly interact with (touch, read, click, speak to etc.)

A good interface must be *usable* and should align to a user's *mental models* (how does s/he expect the interface to work).

### Data

The *fuel* of an app, the raw ingredients that the interface presents to you (more or less *cooked*).

Data is also the information that you provide an app with: the username you type in, the pictures you upload, the geo-location coordinates apps stream...

### Logic

The **coded rules** that determine how the app interface reacts to your *inputs*, how it manipulates data and how it presents it to you (*output*).

At its core, the logic building blocks of an app are statement that sound like `if {this} then {that}`, eg: `if you click on this button, the app will show you this section`.

Many `if {this} then {that}` blocks can build quite complex behaviours.
