# Team project

### Filter Bubbles tutorials

This **team project** is about pushing yourself out of your online comfort zone (aka *filter bubble*) to observe different communities and express your points of view through code.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/filter-bubbles).

### 6 teams

### 10 minutes per team

1. What do you think about [Eli Pariser's TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?language=en#t-53082)?
* What *communities* and/or *hashtags* have you been **researching**?
* Let's see your **ideas** (inspired by?) for visualisations and **code experiments**. 
* What's your team **GitHub repository**? You may want to [create an *organisation*](https://github.com/organizations/new) (a GitHub group) for that..
