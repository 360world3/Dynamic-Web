### Filter Bubbles tutorials

This **team project** is about pushing yourself out of your online comfort zone (aka *filter bubble*) to observe different communities and express your points of view through code.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/filter-bubbles).

### 6 teams

### 10 minutes per team

1. What do you think about [Eli Pariser's TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?language=en#t-53082)?
* What *communities* and/or *hashtags* have you been **researching**?
* Let's see your **ideas** (inspired by?) for visualisations and **code experiments**. 
* What's your team **GitHub repository**? You may want to [create an *organisation*](https://github.com/organizations/new) (a GitHub group) for that.. 


# Codewars

### Are you part of the clan?

If you haven't signed up on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/r/DQC6uA) yet, check out [last week's notes](../02/#codewars) and get started!

Make sure you join the `RaveWebMedia` clan. This way we'll be part of the same team and we'll be able to challenge each other.

### Today

*Before* and *after* your tutorial:

1. Complete at least 2 challenges (aka *katas*) on the beginner level (aka *8 kyu*).
* Have a go at [this *beta kata*](http://www.codewars.com/kata/561bbd27fbbfb0bdad0000f4) which I made..
* [Start making your own kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/new/) and share it with the `RaveWebMedia` clan! 


# Homework

### Peer learning

On the Google document I emailed you (you can also find it on Slack), there's a new table with topics for you to learn and teach next week.

We'll do this again in *teams*, but not the same people you worked with last week.

Your team **mini-lesson** should be **+/- 15 minutes** and you may include:

* **2-3 key ideas**
* **Examples** and demonstrations
* Personal **experiences**
* Other relevant things you've read, heard or seen
 
Prepare **2-3 open questions to ask the class**. After your mini-lesson, we will have a short group discussion around these questions.

#### Topics

1. **jQuery fundamentals**: selecting and manipulating HTML elements. 

	Check out the code examples from [Jon Duckett's *JavaScript & jQuery* book](http://javascriptbook.com/code/c07/) + pages 303-304 and 309-316. 
	
	In your mini-lesson, don't simply *talk about* concepts or techniques. Make live demos that everyone can follow and reproduce on their computers.
* **jQuery events**: triggering code on demand.

	Check out the code examples from [Jon Duckett's *JavaScript & jQuery* book](http://javascriptbook.com/code/c07/) + pages 299 and 333-336. 
	
	In your mini-lesson, don't simply *talk about* concepts or techniques. Make live demos that everyone can follow and reproduce on their computers.
* **AJAX**: sending and receiving data *asynchronously* (that is, while you do something else).

	Check out the code examples from [Jon Duckett's *JavaScript & jQuery* book](http://javascriptbook.com/code/c08/) + pages 377-379, 385, 396 and 415. 
	
	In your mini-lesson, don't simply *talk about* concepts or techniques. Make live demos that everyone can follow and reproduce on their computers. 
* Using the **GeoLocation** API.
	
	Check out the code examples from [Jon Duckett's *JavaScript & jQuery* book](http://javascriptbook.com/code/c09/) + pages 412-414 and 416-419. 
	
	In your mini-lesson, don't simply *talk about* concepts or techniques. Make live demos that everyone can follow and reproduce on their computers. 
* **Mapping (mis)behaviours**: [CrimeTimeline](http://crimetimeline.io), [PrisonMap](http://prisonmap.com/about), [The Refugee Project](http://www.therefugeeproject.org), [Dronestagram](http://shorttermmemoryloss.com/portfolio/project/dronestagram/) and [Pathways](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/pathways). 
 	
 	You are welcome to research and present more projects that mash up different APIs and datasets in interesting ways. 
* The **#selfie** phenomenon: [SelfieCity](http://selfiecity.net).

	Here are blog posts about [designing SelfieCity](http://well-formed-data.net/archives/996/selfiecity) and [the Web-tech behind it](http://do.minik.us/blog/selfiecity).

### Project 

Work on *Filter Bubbles* **with your team**:

* Pick one idea to finalise.
* Continue coding: push your experiments to the team GitHub repo.
* Document your research on your team GitHub repo wiki

### Blog 

**Individually**, write about *Filter Bubbles*. 

Reflect on how the idea is evolving and document **your** thought process. 

Also, write about your coding experiments.
