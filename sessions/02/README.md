# Peer learning

### What is peer learning?

It's a form of **cooperative** learning, that is: learning from *each other, together*.

In peer learning, everybody plays both the **teacher** and the **learner**.

<!-- > Docendo discimus [By teaching, we learn] -->

By teaching to your peers, you reinforce your own learning. [It works](http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/hattie-ranking-teaching-effects)!

Also, you get to practice and build confidence in your **communication skills**.

At the end of your mini-lessons we'll give each other **feedback**. *Honest* feedback can hurt but it's through that (and practice) that we improve.

### Let the peer learning begin

Who | What
--- | -----------
Will<br>Akvile | What are **algorithms**?
Tom<br>Darren | What are **variables** and how do you use them?
Josh<br>Dean | What are **functions** and how do you use them?
Afsara<br>Malore | What are `if` statements (aka **conditionals**) and how do you use them?
Francisco<br>Ajay | What are **loops** and how do you use them?
Ben<br>Rosie | What is the **JavaScript Console** and how do you use it? Check out [JS for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/) for some fun ideas
Joe<br>Rajeev | What is the **GeoLocation** API and how do you use it?  

### Let's give each other *honest* **feedback**

#### Mini-lesson **content**   
	
1. How did you **plan** your mini-lesson?
* What were the **key points** you wanted to get across?
* How did you decide to communicate them?
* What **assumptions** have you made about what we already know?
* How **interactive** was your mini-lesson? How was the audience meant to *participate*? 
	
#### **Delivery**
	
1. What role did each **team member** play in delivering the mini-lesson? 
* How did you **practice** your mini-lesson?
* How did your mini-lesson start? How did you *hook* your audience?
* What was your **body language** like? Consider facial expressions, movements of the arms, eye contact with the audience, and posture.
* What was your **voice** like? Consider speed of delivery, pausing, volume and pitch
* Did you keep within the time?   

#### What can be **improved**?


# Workshop

### Hash Tags (part 2)

All the code for this workshop is [here](../../resources/instagram).

#### Pull data from Instagram for **2 opposite hashtags** and build an expressive display

1. Part 1 is [here](../01#workshop).
* Traversing data: **loops**.

# Codewars

> Improve your skills by training with others on real code challenges

<!--

http://thoughts.baddeo.com/codewars

It gamifies the experience of learning to code in a rather addictive way: 

* a playful environment when solving coding puzzles/challenges (it feels like a game, although it could do with a bit of sound says Aimee)
* get points and level up as you progress
* compare and discuss your solution with those of other members of the community: itâ€™s fascinating to see how other people approach and solve the same challenge and an invaluable learning opportunity

# Homework

### Codewars katas

- [ ] Complete at least 2 challenges (aka *katas*) on the beginner level (aka *8 kyu*).

### Project 

Work on [Filtr Findr](../../projects/filtr-findr):

- [ ] Brainstorm ideas for *your own app*, and upload your sketches / notes to your GitHub repository

### Blog 

Pair up with another person (not your team mate) and **give each other feedback** on your peer learning mini-lessons. 

Use the questions above to give / get feedback on your [mini-lessons' content](#mini-lesson-content) and [delivery](#delivery).

Then write down a *summary* of the feedback you received and a *list of action points* in response to the question:
