* [CodeWars](#codewars)!

### Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!

# Peer learning

6 **teams** of ~3 people each. 

1. [Objects of intense feeling: the case of the Twitter API](http://computationalculture.net/article/objects-of-intense-feeling-the-case-of-the-twitter-api)
* The [Critical Engineering Manifesto](http://criticalengineering.org/) (you can replace `engineer` with `coder` if you feel like making this more relatable)
* [Below the API](http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2015/02/04/google-cabs-and-uber-bots-will-challenge-jobs-below-the-api/)
* Computational thinking
* Functions and functional programming (make examples in JavaScript)
* `for` loops (make examples in JavaScript)




Your team **presentation** (bear in mind, *presentation* does not mean PowerPoint slides.. be creative) should be **~20 minutes** and you may include:

* Summary of main ideas
* Links, images or videos of projects / products / things referenced in your research
* Other relevant things you've read, heard or seen
* Examples and demonstrations
* Personal experiences

Each team should also prepare **1-2 questions for the class**. After your presentation, we will have a short group discussion around these questions.


* Where are you publishing your research and presentation?

# Codewars

> Improve your skills by training with others on real code challenges

<!--

It gamifies the experience of learning to code in a rather addictive way: 

* a playful environment when solving coding puzzles/challenges (it feels like a game, although it could do with a bit of sound says Aimee)
* get points and level up as you progress
* compare and discuss your solution with those of other members of the community: itâ€™s fascinating to see how other people approach and solve the same challenge and an invaluable learning opportunity

1. Before you can sign up you'll have to complete a couple of challenges.
* Click the `JavaScript` button. 
* First challenge
	```js
	function multiply(a, b){
  		a * b
	}
	```
* Second challenge
	```js
	function Person(name){
	  this.name = name;
	}
	
	Person.prototype.greet = function(otherName){
	  return "Hi " + otherName + ", my name is " + name;
	}
	```
* You can now sign up!	

	* Link your GitHub account
	* In the `Clan` field enter **RaveWebMedia**. This way we'll be part of the same team and we'll be able to challenge each other


# Homework

### CodeWars katas

Complete at least 2 challenges (aka *katas*) on the beginner level (aka *8 kyu*).

### Peer learning

1. **Publish** your presentation and any other relevant material. We recommend GitHub (we :green_heart: :octocat:) but you can publish elsewhere as long as it's accessible by anyone.

2. Add the link to your presentation (and any other relevant material) to the `Teams` Google document I emailed you.

### Project 

Work on *Filter Bubbles* **with your team**:

* Refine your work.
* Pick one idea to finalise.
* Continue coding (push experiments to the team GitHub repo).
* Document your research on your team GitHub repo wiki

### Blog 

**Individually**, write about *Filter Bubbles*. 

Reflect on how the idea is evolving and document **your** thought process. 

Also, write about your coding experiments.
