# Peer learning

### A few tips and tricks

#### **FACT** 

Generally, people remember **2-3 ideas** from a talk. Which ones you want them to remember? 

#### **PLANNING** 

Don't try to explain everything. Pick out 2-3 **key ideas** from your topic and explain them in the simplest way you can. 

#### **INTRO** 

Explain the *background* of your talk and give a quick *summary* of what you're going to talk about. People will pay more attention if they have a sense of what's coming next

#### **SLIDES** are not a necessity. 

Ask yourself: is a slideshow the most effective way to communicate this? **How else** could I get this point across?
	
For instance, asking your audience a few *open* questions, getting them to play a game, break them out into small groups to discuss a scenario..

#### **SLIDES AGAIN**	 

If you *must* use slides, then:
	
* One **point** per slide.
	
* Don't cram long texts in your slides. Keep them down to a few *keywords* and one image or two..

#### **DELIVERY** 

Don't read out slides. 

It's distracting both for you and for your audience.

#### **TOP TIP** 

Use **examples** and **stories** from your experience. They will make your points more **relatable**: more interesting to listen to and easier to learn.

### Let the peer learning begin

#### 6 teams

~3 people per team 

#### 15 minutes per team

* ~10 for mini-lesson 
* ~5 for questions and debate

#### Mini-lessons topics

1. **jQuery fundamentals**: selecting and manipulating HTML elements. 
* **jQuery events**: triggering code on demand.
* **AJAX**: sending and receiving data *asynchronously* (that is, while you do something else).
* Using the **GeoLocation** API.

* How **interactive** was your mini-lesson? How was the audience meant to *participate*? 
* What **questions** have you planned to ask your audience? How *open* were those questions? What type of questions (*Right-there*, *Between-the-lines* or *Opinion-needed* questions)?
	
#### **Delivery**
	
1. What role did **visuals** (eg: slides) play in your mini-lesson?
* What role did each **team member** play in delivering the mini-lesson? 
* How did you **practice** your mini-lesson?
