# Formative assessment

### Today

You will **present your project**: 

* [ ] What's your idea?
* [ ] Who is it for?
* [ ] How do you envision it working, looking and feeling? 
* [ ] Let's see your sketches / prototypes.
* [ ] Let's review your code experiments.
* [ ] What's your project GitHub repository? 

> The points above are the bare minimum of what your presentation should include. You're very welcome to present them in a different order and include any other aspects which you consider relevant.

We will give you **verbal feedback** after each presentation.

You will **upload your [hand-in package](#hand-in-package) on Moodle**.

#### Hand-in package

Create a `WEB14203-Name-Surname.md` MarkDown document (where `Name` is your own name and `Surname` is your own surname, like `WEB14203-Matteo-Menapace.md`).

> You can edit MarkDown documents with the [Mou app](http://25.io/mou/) on OSX, the [MarkdownPad app](http://markdownpad.com/) on Windows, or online with [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) (all free).

In that MarkDown document, include the following:

- [ ] Link to your **formative presentation**   

	Preferably a Google Slides link.   
  
	If you use Keynote/Powerpoint export a PDF, upload it to Google Drive or SlideShare, and then grab the link to it.
	
- [ ] Link to your **app** on `gh-pages` :octocat:

- [ ] Link to your Thimble **Firebase pusher**

- [ ] Links to your **blog posts** so far (weeks 1 to 3, [today's post](#blog) is optional)

- [ ] Any other links that you consider relevant

- [	] Images and texts to make your document more pleasant to read (see an example of an excellent `COURSECODE-Name-Surname.md` [here](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/README.md)).

#### Moodle link

> Make sure all the folders, pages, documents & presentations you linked in your `WEB14203-Name-Surname.md` are publicly accessible (not just private to you)!

**Upload and submit** your `WEB14203-Name-Surname.md` through Moodle here [moodle.rave.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=93782](https://moodle.rave.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=93782)

#### Deadline

Friday 4th of November 2016 (aka *today)* at **23:59**! Alright Cinderella? :high_heel:

## After today

We will type up the feedback and share it with you (via Google docs / Slack).

You will reflect on this feedback (*self-assessment*) and write your thoughts in a blog post. See [more details below](#blog).


# Homework

### Codewars katas

Complete at least 2 challenges (aka *katas*) on the beginner levels (aka *8 kyu* or *7 kyu*).

### Blog 

Reflect on the feedback you received during the formative assessment, as well as your experience in this unit so far, and write about it.

Your post should address these questions (in no particular order):

* [ ] How and what did I learn?
* [ ] What worked and what didn't?
* [ ] Did I reach my goals so far, why or why not? (it's ok if you haven't: be honest about it, so that we can work on these together)  
* [ ] How did I feel during the process?
* [ ] My app idea: *persevere*, *[pivot](https://youtu.be/dC_IG-EZQUY?t=29s)* or *panic*?
