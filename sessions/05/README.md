# Formative assessment

<!--- [ ] Why do we do this?-->

#### Today

You will present both your team projects: [FilterBubbles](#filterbubbles). 

We will give you **verbal feedback** after each presentation.

#### After today

We will type up the feedback and share it with you (via Google docs / Slack).

You will get feedback both on your team projects and your individual work.

You will reflect on this feedback (*self-assessment*) and write your thoughts in a blog post. See [more details below]().

### Filter Bubbles

* 6 teams
* **20 minutes** / team

This **team project** is about pushing yourself out of your online comfort zone (aka *filter bubble*) to observe different communities and express your points of view through code.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/filter-bubbles).


# Homework

### Blog 

**Individually**, reflect on the feedback you received during the formative assessment, as well as your experience in this unit so far, and write about it.

Your post should address these questions (in no particular order):

* **ME**:
	* How and what did I learn?
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* Did I reach my goals, why or why not?  
	* How did I feel during the process?  

* My **TEAM**:
	* How did the team perform?
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* What can we do better next time?
	* Did the team reach the goal?
	* Was there conflict, how do we fix it?
