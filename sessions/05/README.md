- [ ] Where's your app at: *persevere*, *[pivot](https://youtu.be/dC_IG-EZQUY?t=29s)* or *panic*?
- [ ] Technical problems you want to discuss
- [ ] Review your blogs


# Homework

### Peer-learning research

Next week we'll dive into *data* and *APIs*.

In small teams, you will research and prepare a **mini-lesson** (~15 minutes) to teach everyone else. 

Your mini-lesson will be **interactive**: no PowerPoint-style presentations. Instead, use print-outs and plan small exercises or and/or **unplugged activities** for your peers to learn the topic you researched.

> ... or should we do peer learning on the PoP? (same as week 2 but with compulsory unplugged activities)

You are welcome to research and present more projects that mash up different APIs and datasets in interesting ways.

### Project

Work on [*Filtr Findr*](../../projects/filtr-findr):

 - [ ] 


### Blog 

*WTF is an API?*

- [ ]Read [The universe is programmable](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/the-universe-is-programmable/) and blog about it: what do you think about the points the author is making?

- [ ] Check out [An API for everything](https://www.producthunt.com/e/an-api-for-everything) and pick at least **three APIs** which you could integrate in your app. Describe how these APIs would impact on the app experience (you won't have to actually use those APIs so feel free to go crazy with ideas...)
