# Week 1

### Today, Tuesday 3rd October 2017

* [Welcome back](#welcome) :)
* How do you design and facilitate a workshop?
* Project: The open protoype  and test(#your-brief)
* [Workshop](#workshop):

### Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!

# Welcome

1. [What is this course about?](../../README.md)
* [What's the plan?](../../README.md#plan)
* [What can you learn?](../../README.md#learning-goals)
* [Rules of the road](../../README.md#rules-of-the-road)
* Keeping a **journal** to record your creative process is extremely important. Don't let your ideas and thoughts fade away! Think of your blog as your *digital sketchbook* (more on that [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging)). We ask you to blog regularly and we'll check that you do it every week.
* **Peer learning**: [one of the most effective ways](http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/hattie-ranking-teaching-effects/) to learn something is to teach it to someone else. During this unit you'll be sharing your skills and knowledge in class, leading mini-tutorials and moderating debates. Starting with [your homework for next week](#peer-learning-research)!


# Your brief

There are 4 parts to the brief that you will need to answer.

1. In class you will design and make a protoype that helps to break down some of the barriers to the 5 spaces that Mozilla explores: Decentralization, Digital Inclusion, Digital Inclusion, Privacy and Security and Web Literacy. You will choose either one or two of those spaces for your prototype to tackle.

2. Collectively you will prepare and make a prototype web platform for the Mozilla festival that shares your concepts and ideas will the festival’s attendees.

3. Collectively you will design and lead a workshop for the Mozilla festival that will showcase your work and gather further insights around the open web from workshop attendees.

4. After the festival you will gather the insights and start building your ideas with advanced web technologies!

# Lecture

In a workshop there are several different ingredients that need to be included.

### Divergent

The first phase is about opening the people minds to new possibilities and visions. You can think of this phase as the big bang! The opening is not the time for critical thinking or sceptisism; its the phase for blue-sky thinking, brainstorming, energy and optimisim.

### Emergent

In the second phase the energy has been set and the ideas should be flowing in the room. This is where you can test you ideas and see old things in a new light. Shift, sift and test things, and so on.

### Convergent

When you have reached the final phase you would want to start to move towards conclusions and decisions. This is the moment when you start to look at your feedback and ideas with a critical eye. You can not purpose every opportunities, therefore, this stage allows you to make decisions.


# Workshop

1. Start exploring what it means to create a workshop

* What is the problem?

* What is the need?

3. Start rapid prototyping ideas

# Homework

### Peer-learning research

See shared PDF on Gamestorming and each group are going to cover a topic and present back your findings. The information can be found on page 15 to 26.

* What did you learn from this section?
* How will it influence your workshop?
