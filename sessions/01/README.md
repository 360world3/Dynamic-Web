* [Welcome back](#welcome) :)
* How do you design and facilitate a workshop?
* Project: The open protoype  and test(#your-brief)
* [Workshop](#workshop):

### Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!

# Welcome

1. [What is this course about?](../../README.md)
* [What's the plan?](../../README.md#plan)
* [What can you learn?](../../README.md#learning-goals)
* [Rules of the road](../../README.md#rules-of-the-road)
* Keeping a **journal** to record your creative process is extremely important. Don't let your ideas and thoughts fade away! Think of your blog as your *digital sketchbook* (more on that [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging)). We ask you to blog regularly and we'll check that you do it every week.
* **Peer learning**: [one of the most effective ways](http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/hattie-ranking-teaching-effects/) to learn something is to teach it to someone else. During this unit you'll be sharing your skills and knowledge in class, leading mini-tutorials and moderating debates. Starting with [your homework for next week](#peer-learning-research)!


# Your brief

There are 4 parts to the brief that you will need to answer.

1. In class you will design and make a protoype that helps to break down some of the barriers to the 5 spaces that Mozilla explores: Decentralization, Digital Inclusion, Digital Inclusion, Privacy and Security and Web Literacy. You will choose either one or two of those spaces for your prototype to tackle.

2. Collectively you will prepare and make a prototype web platform for the Mozilla festival that shares your concepts and ideas will the festival’s attendees.

3. Collectively you will design and lead a workshop for the Mozilla festival that will showcase your work and gather further insights around the open web from workshop attendees.

4. After the festival you will gather the insights and start building your ideas with advanced web technologies!

# Workshop

1. Start exploring what it means to create a workshop

2. Explore the Mozilla themes in groups (Create a 5minute presentation)

* What is the problem?
