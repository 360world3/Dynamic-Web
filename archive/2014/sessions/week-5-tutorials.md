# App tutorials

## Simeron

#### Idea 1

* Bookmarking / recommending places? Too similar to Foursquare

#### Idea 2

* `Never make the same mistake again`. You go out, have a terrible experience and decide to make a note of that so that you will never go there again. Or you order from a shop that is rubbish, and you need to remind yourself `why was it rubbish again?`
* Could link to [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)?
* When you pass by a certain place it reminds you how bad it was.
* What is the least worst place?
* Where do you NOT want to go out today?

#### Idea 3

* Decide between two things while quickly flipping between many things
* Based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwziXSeabd4)
* `As mum did it, but as an app`

#### TODO

- [ ] Sketch out interfaces
- [ ] Start building it with HTML & CSS

Inspired by [How much should I charge?](http://thenuschool.com/how-much/)

Take a look at [this tool](http://www.futuremorph.org/wp-content/uploads/games/interactive/index.html)

#### TODO

- [ ] Model your data on this [spreasheet](https://docs.google.com/a/rave.ac.uk/spreadsheets/d/1TBRpVkTzhPRTlPZr_JexswiX5vp6YBu2dVUikPyEo78/edit?usp=sharing)
- [ ] Sketch the app with HTML & CSS

App is about **killing time**, it asks you (up to) 5 questions and then gives you suggestions based on your answers.

1. How much time do you have?
* How are you feeling? Active, lazy..
* etc

Could include a weather API behind the scenes

#### TODO

- [ ] Model your data on this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/rave.ac.uk/spreadsheets/d/1zqqN_IZtpfGRRq9bQpi_SZVUp4MCjHy9VX4ttRCPMqQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- [ ] Sketch the app with HTML & CSS



## Harry

1. Shows you where coffee shops that are not a horrible chain are on a map
* List view
* Loyalty scheme of individual coffee shops
* Review
* Drinks menu

#### TODO

- [ ] Research similar apps and review them. 
- [ ] Play around with Google Maps API (both for mapping layer and businesses database)
- [ ] Consider using [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) to build your own database of customers and places?



## Matt

App tells you how to feel today, based on the weather (but without telling you that it's based on the weather).

Could be an alarm clock or similar, quick interaction.

Two branches: `I agree` with the mood that the app tells me, or `I disagree` with the app.

#### TODO

- [ ] Make a **storyboard** of how people experience the app.
- [ ] Research into the technologies (weather API, different sounds played depending on the weather/mood, how to make a Web-based alarm clock)
