# Dynamic Web assessment checklist

Your final mark will be based on:

* [70% project](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/assessment-criteria.md#project)
* [20% blog](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/assessment-criteria.md#blog)
* [10% attendance](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/assessment-criteria.md#attendance)



# Project

All your project files **must be pushed to GitHub**, in the *branch* called with your name, inside your *folder*

(eg: branch: `matteo`, folder: `students/matteo`)

![Readme ME](http://i.imgur.com/edNKhBT.png)

In your folder, include a **README.md** file that introduces your app and explains how it works. It must 

* be at least 200 words  
* have a couple of images/screenshots (more than two are welcome of course)
* include at least one link to research or inspiration
* include links to all your blog posts ([guidelines on bloggging here](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/assessment-criteria.md#blog)) 

**MD** stands for `MarkDown` and it's just a text file that GitHub converts to HTML. 

You're reading a MD file right now, and there are plenty of MD files in this repository, [here](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/tree/master/notes).

Here is an [easy guide (3 minutes)](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) on writing MarkDown.

You can use [this free app](http://25.io/mou/) to craft <abbr title="MarkDown">MD</abbr> files on OSX, or [this free one](http://markdownpad.com/) for Windows. 



# Blog

Your blog is a **self-assessment** and creative process **documentation tool**. 

We don’t ask you to blog to fill your time. Documenting your project through a blog helps you develop your **critical thinking and analysis skills**. Just writing all positive, unspecific things about a project doesn’t exercise those analytic mind muscles.

We discussed blogging on week 5, here are some [notes from that day](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-5.md#general-observations).

![blog ON](http://i.imgur.com/9U2OO22.png?1)

Your blog should have at least 6 posts.

Topics from each week:

1. Building the *Help me decide* app with HTML, JS and a bit of CSS
* [*Draw the Web*](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-2.md#homework)
* [Brainswarming ideas, and how my app idea is evolving.](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-3.md#homework)
* [MozFest](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-4.md#assignment-for-next-week)
* [App key screens and description](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-5.md#assignment-for-nextish-week)
* [App breakdown](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-6.md#app-logic-breakdown)
* [Developing my app](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-7.md#assignment-for-next-week)
* [What have I learned?](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-8.md#assignment-for-next-week)


You can blog be either on [4F](http://www.fourthfloor.me/) or [Medium](https://medium.com). Tumblr is also ok.



# Attendance

1.1% of your grade for each session attended (9 in total).



# Learning goals

Upon completion of this unit you will (hopefully) be able to: 

* Create **proof-of-concept functional prototypes** for Web applications, which manipulate data from online database(s) and/or API(s).

* Critically analyze the **mechanics** of a Web application, breaking down its behaviour into *data*, *functions* and *logic*.

* Understand the role of the three pillar **technologies** of the Web: *HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*.

* Understand how **data APIs** work (HTTP requests, API keys, URL parameters) and hook up one (or more) APIs to your Web application.

* **Research** and use **code libraries** (such as *jQuery*) and integrate them in your project.

* **Document** your design and development process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including *successes* and *failures*.

* **Communicate** your ideas both technically and in an engaging way.

* **Back-up** your project files using the Git version-control system (through GitHub).


Skills learnt in this unit will lay the foundations for later units in the year curriculum.
