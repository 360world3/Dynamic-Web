# Dynamic Web assessment checklist

Your final mark will be based on:

* [75% project](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/assessment-criteria.md#project)
* [25% blog](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/assessment-criteria.md#blog)


# Project

All your project files **must be pushed to GitHub**, in the *branch* called with your name, inside your *folder*

(for example, branch: `matteo`, folder: `students/matteo`)

![Readme ME](http://i.imgur.com/edNKhBT.png)

In your folder, include a **README.md** file that introduces your app and explains how it works. It must 

* be at least 200 words  
* have a couple of images/screenshots (more than two are welcome of course)
* include at least one link to research or inspiration
* include links to all your blog posts ([guidelines on bloggging here](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/assessment-criteria.md#blog)) 

**MD** stands for `MarkDown` and it's just a text file that GitHub converts to HTML. 

You're reading a MD file right now, and there are plenty of MD files in the GitHub repository for this project, for instance [here](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/tree/master/notes).

Here is an [easy guide (3 minutes)](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) on writing MarkDown.

You can use [this free app](http://25.io/mou/) to craft <abbr title="MarkDown">MD</abbr> files on OSX, or [this free one](http://markdownpad.com/) for Windows. 



# Blog

Your blog is a **self-assessment** and creative process **documentation tool**. 

We don’t ask you to blog to fill your time. Documenting your project through a blog helps you develop your **critical thinking and analysis skills**. Just writing all positive, unspecific things about a project doesn’t exercise those analytic mind muscles.

We discussed blogging on week 5, here are some [notes from that day](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-5.md#general-observations).

![blog ON](http://i.imgur.com/9U2OO22.png?1)

Your blog should have at least 6 posts.
