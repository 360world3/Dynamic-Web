During this project you will learn how to mash up Web technologies to make tools (aka *apps*) that everyone can use. 

In particular, you will

* get familiar with the principles of functional and object-oriented programming, putting these into practice with JavaScript
* develop your computational thinking skills with weekly coding challenges
* research and use code libraries (such as jQuery) and integrate them in your project
* analyse the mechanics of applications, breaking down their behaviours into data, functions and logic  
* experiment with Web APIs (both data APIs and interaction APIs)
* create proof-of-concept functional prototypes for Web applications, which manipulate data from online database(s) and/or API(s)
* work in teams, learning from your peers and teaching them what you learned
* document your work regularly and reflect on your creative process
* communicate your ideas both technically and in an engaging way
* back up your project files using the Git version-control system (through GitHub)
