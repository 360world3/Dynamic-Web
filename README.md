### During this course you will learn how to:
* Design and facilitate workshops
* Test your prototypes with users
* mash up Web technologies to make tools (aka *apps*) that everyone can use.

In particular, you will:

* Learn how to design a workshop
* Become familiar with facilitating a workshop
* Get familiar with the principles of programming, putting these into practice with **JavaScript**
* Research and use code libraries (such as **jQuery**) and integrate them in your project
* Develop your **computational thinking** skills with weekly coding challenges
* Analyse the mechanics of applications, breaking down their behaviours into *data*, *functions* and *logic*  
* Create proof-of-concept functional **prototypes** for Web applications, which manipulate data from online database(s) and/or API(s)
* Work in **teams**, learning from your peers and teaching them what you learned
* **Document** your work regularly and reflect on your creative process
* **Communicate** your ideas both technically and in an engaging way
* Back up your project files using the Git version-control system (through **GitHub**)

<!-- * Play critically with **Web APIs** (both data APIs and interaction APIs) -->

# Project

### Part 1: Design and facilitate a workshop at the Mozilla Festival where you can test your prototypes

### Part 2: Bring your prototypes to life with code

This **individual project** is about using code and data to create a helpful experience for a community of people.

All the project material is [here](projects/filtr-findr).


# Learning goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Create **proof-of-concept functional prototypes** for Web applications, which manipulate data from online database(s) and/or API(s).
* Analyse the **mechanics** of a Web application, breaking down its behaviour into *data*, *functions* and *logic*.
* Understand the role of the three pillar **technologies** of the Web: *HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*.
* **Research** and use **interaction APIs** (aka code libraries like *jQuery*) and integrate them in your project.  
* Understand how **data APIs** function (HTTP requests, API keys, URL parameters etc.) and hook up one or more APIs to your Web application.
* Apply your understanding and **experiment** on your own: refine, test and *debug* your code.
* Feel confident **searching** for solutions to design challenges and coding issues.
* Look **critically** at APIs as **communication protocols** that are made and enforced by people: what does an API allow you to do, what does it not, who should be able to use it and why, are some of the questions you will seek to answer.
* **Document** your design and development process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including *successes* and *failures*.
* **Communicate** your ideas both technically and in an engaging way.

# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts.
* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
