## App description

Indecisive? Then look no further than this app! This app is designed to help people who may find themselves it everyday predicaments like.. “Trainer or ugg boots”, “Mc Donald’s or KFC”, or “fruit or chocolate”This app will help you make a decision without even knowing that you’ve made the decision!        This app is built for everyone and anyone making a decision. It’s to help the consumer decide between two options. Simply place the two options into the boxes and press go. This takes the user to a string of questions of which they have to answer as fast as they can without thinking about it. There is a time limit so if they haven’t decided then the user will be notified about this to encourage them to make a decision. Somewhere within this set of questions the users two options will be hidden as a pair and the user without thinking will click on one. At the end of the string of questions the user will be presented with the option they clicked on. 

Decision made. ☺

## Research and inspiration 

###Primary research
I found the brain swarming a very good way to come up with ideas, and was the initial bases from where most of my ideas were formed. This helped me look at situations in where I have been indecisive and I could have used something to help me make a decision. This was a good starting point to form ideas, however I am a very indecisive person so even though I found this, a good method to carry out primary research as I was looking at what situations could be improved with this app.

###Secondary research
My secondary research came about when I was informed that my initial idea for my app was very similar to ‘4 square’ so I researched the app to how similar it was and I found the opening line on the site was very similar to the whole concept I was going of” Introducing the all-new Foursquare, which learns what you like and leads you to places you’ll love. So after looking at avenues that allowed to me to use a similar concept, I decided this was no longer an app I wanted to make and decided to go back to the drawing board in coming up with a new idea.

###Inspiration
This was when I came up with the idea for the app that helps you make a decision without thinking about it. So it is more about letting you sub consciousness make the decision without the user making to much effort. Initially I heard the idea being spoken about amongst friends which trying to decide on an initial idea. The main inspiration for this app is from an episode of the hit US comedy friends. See link here for clip. I think this is the best way to convey what my app does and what I am trying to create.
