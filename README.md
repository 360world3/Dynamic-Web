# Colour Boost

This little app's roots reside in the minds of every single player. Taking inspiration from colour psychology and the effect it has on us is the main work behind the scenes. Exploring the user’s personal preferences such as their favourite colour and taking into account their needs from a dropdown list provided, it combines the perfect recipe to achieve those needs.The app works by making the user interact with the colour that will best relate to the ‘need’ previously selected, this is by based on a colour phycology matrix I’ve compiled together. E.g Green boosts creativity.  The app does this by creating a simple game and customizing it to the time the user wants to play for. !Important: the app has been created for entertainment purposes only.  

## Inspiration

I wanted to center my work around colours and soon I realised to take into account the psychology side of it.

Colour psychology is said to be the relation we have with a colour, with what we associate it, finally reacting to it accordingly. However as culture, upbringing, and personal experiences changes our perspective; these meanings can’t be taken literally for every person. 

For example Eastern and Asian cultures might argue that red brings happiness, luck, and long life while other cultures might argue the opposite.

The background patterns changes randomly based on the user's input on favourite colour. I'm using ColorLOVERS API to do this.
