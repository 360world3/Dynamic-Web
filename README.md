### During this course you will learn how to mash up Web technologies to make tools (aka *apps*) that everyone can use. 

In particular, you will:

* Get familiar with the principles of functional and object-oriented programming, putting these into practice with **JavaScript**
* Develop your **computational thinking** skills with weekly coding challenges
* Research and use code libraries (such as **jQuery**) and integrate them in your project
* Analyse the mechanics of applications, breaking down their behaviours into *data*, *functions* and *logic*  
* Play critically with **Web APIs** (both data APIs and interaction APIs)
* Create proof-of-concept functional **prototypes** for Web applications, which manipulate data from online database(s) and/or API(s)
* Work in **teams**, learning from your peers and teaching them what you learned
* **Document** your work regularly and reflect on your creative process
* **Communicate** your ideas both technically and in an engaging way
* Back up your project files using the Git version-control system (through **GitHub**)

# Projects

### Filter Bubbles

This **team project** is about pushing yourself out of your online comfort zone (aka *filter bubble*) to observe different communities and express your points of view through code.

All the project material is [here](projects/filter-bubbles).

### Making Noise

This project is about functional and object-oriented programming, creating your own API and having fun with code-generated sound.

### Time Table

This **team project** is about designing interfaces and coding apps that use data to provide people with *just enough information*. 


# Learning goals

* Create **proof-of-concept functional prototypes** for Web applications, which manipulate data from online database(s) and/or API(s).

* Analyse the **mechanics** of a Web application, breaking down its behaviour into *data*, *functions* and *logic*.

* Understand the role of the three pillar **technologies** of the Web: *HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*.

* **Research** and use **interaction APIs** (aka code libraries like *jQuery*) and integrate them in your project.  

* Understand how **data APIs** function (HTTP requests, API keys, URL parameters etc.) and hook up one or more APIs to your Web application.

* Look **critically** at APIs as **communication protocols** that are made and enforced by people: what does an API allow you to do, what does it not, who should be able to use it and why, are some of the questions you will seek to answer

* **Document** your design and development process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including *successes* and *failures*.

* **Communicate** your ideas both technically and in an engaging way.

* Use the Git version-control system (through GitHub) to **collaborate** with your team and **back-up** your project files.

# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts. We'll deduct 2% from your grade for each uncommunicated tardiness or absence (aka the *2% Tardiness Tax*).
* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
