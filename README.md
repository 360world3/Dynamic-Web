##Purpose
Welcome to Not Another Starbucks
The purpose of this application is to solve the problem of finding a coffee shop near to your current location that isn't part of a big coffee chain. After doing investigation into UK coffee sales I found that in 2012 80% of coffee sold in the UK was sold by just Costa and Starbucks. There are a lot of people who are not OK with that, the average consumer has become more educated on big business and has more motivation than ever to support smaller independant retailers. NAS (Not Another Starbucks) will solve this problem begining with london by showing your location on a map and loadting markers showing where your nearest independant coffee retailers are using it's own database of Coffee Shops. NAS hopes to compete with bigger coffee companies by in future adding a unified loyalty scheme for these independant retailers so that they are able to compete with the big businesses.

##User Guide
###Start Up
When opening the app you will be presented with a loading screen which displauys the apps logo whilst the app is loading, this should usually only take around 5 seconds. You may be asked permission for us to use your location, this is simply to display where you are on the map so we can show you the coffee shops closest to you. If you deny access to your location you will still be able to use the application but you will begin with a map displaying the entire world rather than a view of your location. Sometimes your browser may not have permission to use location services especially on mobile devices so you have to change your settings, this setting is usually in privacy. Once the loading screen fades your should be presented with your map.
###Map Design
NAS uses a custom map tile design to give us a really cool feel, this isn't necessaily the clearest way to view the map so if you would like to switch to a more traditional style map you can choose the settings menu on the top right (cog icon) and turn on normal mapping.

###Markers
Your position is represented bhy the coffee cup icon, this icon has a blue circle below it, this circle's radius shows the level of accuracy to which your location is being displayed, for an exact measure of this in meters just click on this icon. The coffee bean icon shows the location of coffee shops on the map, these should always be accurate as they are defined by longitude and latitude. When you click on these coffee bean icons you are given information about these coffee shops:

* The name of the coffee shop links to their website if one is available
* The first line of address and the postcode are then displayed below this
* Opening times sourced from a 3rd party website (usually google maps or foursquare) are then displayed.
* The phone number is also displayed, when pressed from a mobile device or certain computers this will place a call using the default calling app of the device.
* Whether the coffee shop has Wifi is also displayed, this is also 3rd party sourced.
* Get directions is the last option, when this link is pressed a route to the coffee shop you've chosen from your location is displayed. this is marked with a red line which shows you a reccomended route by road. You can also view these directions as a list using the get view directions list which appears when you are in directions mode.

###Zooming
Native zooming of the device you are using is supported so pinch to zoom on most mobile devices will allow you to control your view. If you would prefer to use a menu control in the top left with a + and - sign that allow you to adjust your zoome level.
###Menu
The menu in the top right gives the user various options, as mention previously there is a settings menu represented by the cog, this gives the user the normal map view setting and also some helpful tips on using the app below this option, you can close this window either by clicking the grey X in the top right.
The profile part of the menu represented by the man icon is where the loyalty card functionality will be added to application eventually in future iterations, currently it has a form to enter your name and email address to sumbit to joion the NAS emailing list, if you choose to submit your email you will be presented woith a thank you page and eventually you will loop back around to the map page. The last part of the menu represented by the 3 line tool allows you to view the coffee shops as a list instead of on a map, this page is full screen so can only be exited with the cross in the top right.
