##Purpose
Welcome to Not Another Starbucks
The purpose of this application is to solve the problem of finding a coffee shop near to your current location that isn't part of a big coffee chain. After doing investigation into UK coffee sales I found that in 2012 80% of coffee sold in the UK was sold by just Costa and Starbucks. There are a lot of people who are not OK with that, the average consumer has become more educated on big business and has more motivation than ever to support smaller independant retailers. NAS (Not Another Starbucks) will solve this problem begining with london by showing your location on a map and loadting markers showing where your nearest independant coffee retailers are using it's own database of Coffee Shops. NAS hopes to compete with bigger coffee companies by in future adding a unified loyalty scheme for these independant retailers so that they are able to compete with the big businesses.

##User Guide
###Start Up
When opening the app you will be presented with a loading screen which displauys the apps logo whilst the app is loading, this should usually only take around 5 seconds. You may be asked permission for us to use your location, this is simply to display where you are on the map so we can show you the coffee shops closest to you. If you deny access to your location you will still be able to use the application but you will begin with a map displaying the entire world rather than a view of your location. Sometimes your browser may not have permission to use location services especially on mobile devices so you have to change your settings, this setting is usually in privacy. Once the loading screen fades your should be presented with your map.
###Map Design
NAS uses a custom map tile design to give us a really cool feel, this isn't necessaily the clearest way to view the map so if you would like to switch to a more traditional style map you can choose the settings menu on the top right (cog icon) and turn on normal mapping.
