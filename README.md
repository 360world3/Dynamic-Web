During this project you will learn how to mash up Web technologies to make tools (aka *apps*) that everyone can use. 

In particular, you will

* get familiar with the principles of functional and object-oriented programming, putting these into practice with JavaScript
* develop your computational thinking skills with weekly coding challenges
* research and use code libraries (such as jQuery) and integrate them in your project
* analyse the mechanics of applications, breaking down their behaviours into data, functions and logic  
* play critically with Web APIs (both data APIs and interaction APIs)
* create proof-of-concept functional prototypes for Web applications, which manipulate data from online database(s) and/or API(s)
* work in teams, learning from your peers and teaching them what you learned
* document your work regularly and reflect on your creative process
* communicate your ideas both technically and in an engaging way
* back up your project files using the Git version-control system (through GitHub)

# Projects

### Filter bubbles

This **team project** is about pushing yourself out of your online comfort zone (aka *filter bubble*) to observe different communities and express your points of view through code.

All the project material [here](projects/filter-bubbls).


# Learning goals

* Create **proof-of-concept functional prototypes** for Web applications, which manipulate data from online database(s) and/or API(s).

* Analyse the **mechanics** of a Web application, breaking down its behaviour into *data*, *functions* and *logic*.

* Understand the role of the three pillar **technologies** of the Web: *HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*.

* **Research** and use **interaction APIs** (aka code libraries like *jQuery*) and integrate them in your project.  

* Understand how **data APIs** function (HTTP requests, API keys, URL parameters etc.) and hook up one or more APIs to your Web application.

* Look **critically** at APIs as **communication protocols** that are made and enforced by people: what does an API allow you to do, what does it not, who should be able to use it and why, are some of the questions you will seek to answer

* **Document** your design and development process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including *successes* and *failures*.

* **Communicate** your ideas both technically and in an engaging way.

* Use the Git version-control system (through GitHub) to **collaborate** with your team and **back-up** your project files.
