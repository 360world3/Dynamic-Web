If you want to have **good ideas** you must [have **many ideas**](https://medium.com/founder-stories/9bd554bedce0).

**Most** of them will be **wrong**, and what you have to learn is which ones to throw away.

Ideas are often “scraching your own itch”, and as such, the things that seem to work are scratchy apps.

It’s fine to scratch your own itch, but are you really **passionate about an idea**?

* Let's discuss your idea and then come up with another two. SO that we have **3 ideas** (at least)

## There (should be) an app for that

### Form pairs

1. **Who** is this app for?
* **What** are they achieving with it?
* **How** are they using this app? 
* **Why** would they not use a {insert something} instead?
* Are there **other apps** you find inspiring/relevant? Put links and images/screenshots aplenty

### Presentations

* **Present** your *partner*'s idea (eg: Kim presents Innocent's idea)
* You have about 1 minute each
* As the *app's inventor* you can chip in while your *partner* is presenting
* Make sure you never say **But**. Instead, interrupt the other presenter with **Yes, and...**
