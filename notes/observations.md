## [Week 1](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-1.md)

* `var option2 = $("input[name=option2]").val()` was confusing to most people (use `id` instead?)
* `event.preventDefault()` is way over the heads of many people: just don't use a `form` for an intro/beginner exercise

## [Week 2](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-2.md)

* Brain-swarming works well and people enjoy it (so they say and write in their blogs, for example [Matt](https://github.com/MatthewStarr) writes that *I really liked this method of expanding ideas and would definitely do it future group projects*)!
* Showing the [jQuery docs](http://api.jquery.com/on/) didn't really work. Need to explain functions and arguments first (POP with unplugged activity, and `makeTea`)

## [Week 3](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-3.md)

* `String concatenation`, `variables` and `object navigation` still a bit confusing/unknown, but they're getting there
* Using the Flickr API to give a *Pictionary-style* answer worked well :) I think anything that yields tangible/visible (images), surprising results is a win!
* Explained [`jQuery.ajax()`](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) by mentioning the cleaning product, football club and Greek hero

## [Week 4](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-4.md)

* Pair presentations with *yes, and* worked well
* Codecademy fail: people drifted off. Let's see if these kind of resources work as *homework assignment*.
* Why should I go to MozFest?
	* Because you'll get *both new technological stuff and free drinks, which are two of my favourite things in the world..* ([Margot](https://github.com/Myrtilletamere))  
	* You may get a change to sing in a geeky karaoke
	* You may get a free phone (this happened at MozFest 2014)
	
	
	
	
## Famous quotes

* [Kimberly](https://github.com/kimberlys) writes that *using jQuery I was able to understand and structure the code based thanks to the similarity with CSS*
