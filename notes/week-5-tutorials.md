#### Idea 1

* Bookmarking / recommending places? too similar to Foursquare

#### Idea 2

* `Never make the same mistake again`. You go out, have a terrible experience and decide to make a note of that so that you will never go there again. Or you order from a shop that is rubbish, and you need to remind yourself `why was it rubbish again?`
* Could link to [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)?
* When you pass by a certain place it reminds you how bad it was.
* What is the least worst place?
* Where do you NOT want to go out today?

#### Idea 3

* Decide between two things while quickly flipping between many things
* Based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwziXSeabd4)
* `As mum did it, but as an app`

App is about **killing time**, it asks you (up to) 5 questions and then gives you suggestions based on your answers.


1. How much time do you have?
* How are you feeling? Active, lazy..
* etc
