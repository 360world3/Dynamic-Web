- [ ] 3 things I learned in each blog post
- [ ] How to use categories in WP (create post for week 2 notes)



## Did you draw the Web?

* Let's look for emerging **patterns**
* What does the Web **mean to you**?

http://www.fourthfloor.me/blogs/mmercier/2014/10/09/draw-the-web/ :)



## Open what?

The Web is full of resources: **open-source** code and **open data** that you can use to make amazing apps!

* Free? Why?
* What is **open-source**? Libraries (jQuery), GitHub, reputation economy..
* What is **open data**? APIs, WikiPedia


## What's an API then?


## Let's mash up two APIs

(The easy task before the challenging one..)

Introducing [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)


## API exercise (2h) 

Start from the *Help me decide app*

* Sending data through forms (Google search, AJAX)
* URLs for humans and for data (Facebook example)

* Install [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en)

http://www.datatables.org/

https://developer.yahoo.com/yql




#### Learning objectives

* jQuery selectors
* branching logic (simple y/n for now)
* console.log
* head**ing** not head**er**


## Remember your brief?

Make an app that helps people **make a decision**.

The app must take in some human **input**, use **code** to manipulate it, and then present a human-readable **output**.

You can use **data** from the Web to help people make a decision.

## More inspirations

- [ ] Beyond *yourselfie*, apps that use APIs with a purpose


1. [How much should I charge?](http://thenuschool.com/how-much/)
*  Haiti earthquake map


## Feedback on ideas (30 min)

* Form pairs
* [ ] Give it a structure / questions to consider


## Homework for next week

* Review your peer's idea and write about it in the blog.














Nice one Liam!

Couple of points:
* h1, h2 etc are called <i>heading</i>s, not <i>header</i>s (which is another HTML element)
* Make sure to use the category <a href="http://www.fourthfloor.me/blogs/lparker/category/WEB14203/">WEB14203</a> for blog posts about the Dynamic Web unit.
