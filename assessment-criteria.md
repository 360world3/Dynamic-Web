## Project

### Brief

Make an app that helps people **make a decision**.

The app must take in some human **input**, use **code** to manipulate it, and then present a human-readable **output**.

You can use **data** from the Web to help people make a decision.

### Components

1. **Interface**, aka *front-end*: it is the information users see/read and the inputs they use to interact with the app.
2. **Data services**, aka *back-end*: the app should be able to read from at least one of online service, eg: a database such as Google Spreadsheet, or a data API such as a Weather API.
3. **Logic**: it's what binds the interface with the data the app manipulates. 
4. **Workflow**: all your project files on GitHub.

### Grades

#### F

[M.I.A.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action) The student failed to deliver the assignment. 

#### E

The app is neither functional nor well-presented. It doesn't work, has major bugs or is incomplete to a point that is impossible to get a clear idea of the user experience.

#### D

The app is buggy and unstyled. It is possible to get a glimpse of the user experience, however there are functional problems that prevent it from working as a demo / proof-of-concept, as well as an interface that doesn't elicit interaction.

#### C

The app is styled but buggy. The interface is well presented, however there are problems with the app's logic and/or with the data services it uses.

#### B

The app is functional and styled.  The prototype is functional and complete in all of its parts. Good technical execution.

#### A

The app is functional and styled, and its source-code is well commented. Outstanding implementation.
