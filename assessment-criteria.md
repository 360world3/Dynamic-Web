## Project

### Brief

Make an app that helps people **make a decision**.

The app must take in some human **input**, use **code** to manipulate it, and then present a human-readable **output**.

You can use **data** from the Web to help people make a decision.

### Components

1. **Interface**, aka *front-end*: it is the information users see/read and the inputs they use to interact with the app.
2. **Data services**, aka *back-end*: the app should be able to read from at least one of online service, eg: a database such as Google Spreadsheet, or a data API such as a Weather API.
3. **Logic**: it's what binds the interface with the data the app manipulates. 
4. **Workflow**: all your project files on GitHub.

### Grades

#### F

[M.I.A.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action) The student failed to deliver the assignment. 

#### E

The app is neither functional nor well-presented. It doesn't work, has major bugs or is incomplete to a point that is impossible to get a clear idea of the user experience.

#### D

The app is buggy and unstyled. It is possible to get a glimpse of the user experience, however there are functional problems that prevent it from working as a demo / proof-of-concept, as well as an interface that doesn't elicit interaction.

#### C

The app is styled but buggy. The interface is well presented, however there are problems with the app's logic and/or with the data services it uses.

#### B

The app is functional and styled.  The prototype is functional and complete in all of its parts. Good technical execution.

#### A

The app is functional and styled, and its source-code is well commented. Outstanding implementation.

#### F

[M.I.A.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action) The student failed to deliver the assignment. 

#### E

There are less than 6 posts.

They mostly consist of one or two disconnected sentences. They are disorganised and do not reflect what was done in class.

#### D

There are less than 6 posts. 

They are unfocused, or simply rehashing existing material, and there is minimal reference to what is heard / made in or outside class.

#### C

There are 6 or more posts. 

Posts are mostly made of descriptions or summaries, without consideration of alternative perspectives. A few connections are made between ideas, but there are very few links and attributions, and little evidence of research.

Informative but not quite interesting to read. 

#### B

There are 6 or more posts. 

Posts are reasonably focused, and explanations or analysis are mostly based on examples or other evidence. A few links and attributions of ideas, little evidence of research and some visuals to illustrate concepts.

Informative and quite interesting to read. 

#### A

There are 6 or more posts. 

Posts are focused and coherently integrate examples with explanations or analysis. Lots of links and attributions of ideas, evidence of research and visuals to illustrate concepts.

Informative and interesting to read.
